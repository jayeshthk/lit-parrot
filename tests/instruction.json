In general, we are proceeding in a good direction, but is by no means closed yet. I had a meeting with the Project Manager Mr.Shozen, and the situation is as follows:\n.1 PDA Selection\n- Bayer is currently leaning towards the Toshiba PDA although this is not yet fixed (Toshiba has the most aggressive pricing at this point, and users like it)\n- The PDA selection is pure economics: they will choose the least expensive (iPaq, Toshiba, Casio)\n- In the event that they choose Toshiba, Siebel has no play (Siebel has confirmed this)\n2. Siebel Status\n- Siebel is still struggling to get 7.5.2 Server (ePharma) up and running in Bayer's environment\n- Siebel has only been able to show HH Vanilla on 7.5.1\n- They have NOT been able to show HH  ePharma  on 7.5.1 nor 7.5.2\n- Mr.Shozen is frustrated with Siebel's slow response (on all fronts, Server and HH) and has officially asked the CRM lead exec in Germany to warn Siebel (Bayer will most likely become a  red  account which will draw attention from Tom Siebel as well)\n3. Proof of Concept and User Board\n- Bayer really likes the Proof of Concept that EP built for them (unique UI with calendar and weekly action list)\n- User Board will be held on 9/20 to show EP UI\n- In the event that the User Board likes what they see, Mr.Shozen will officially be able to push EP internally\n- Mr. Shozen believes that he can push EP through if User Board is on our side\n4. Cost and Decision\n- EP presented pricing to basically match Siebel HH pricing (first phase appx 250K in license)\n- Wild Card is the Siebel HH license cost: from a Bayer worldwide perspective, they may have already bought HH depending on remaining bulk commitment/purchase amount (Mr.Shozen will check this, Bayer may or may not have any cash out for Siebel)\n- Provided that EP has User Board support, final decision will be made by CFO/Controller Mr.Schwarz and Mr.Mardin (Mr.Shozen's boss)\n- The choice of vendor will be made by end of Sept.\nOur best case scenario will be an LOI at end of Sept. We are currently working on improving the UI which is key to get the User Board on our side. The probability of getting this account has improved and we are moving forward step by step. However, it is still an uphill battle considering the fact that they have the prior bulk purchase WW.\nI will give an detailed update in eStaff next Monday.

According to analysts, this is a necessary step because\nthese companies' target is a workforce of consumers displaying diminishing\nbrand loyalty in order to access their business and personal data wherever\nthey are.\n These are the industries that are time-and location-sensitive,  said Kelly\nQuinn, senior analyst at Aberdeen Group, in Boston.\nFor traditional companies, maintaining existing customers rather than\nattracting new ones appears to be the greatest impetus for deploying a\nmobile solution. Mark Ebel, director of digital communication services at\nMinneapolis-based BestBuy, the No. 1 brick-and-mortar retailer in consumer\nelectronics in the United States with annual sales of $12.5 billion, noted\nthat an erosion of electronics purchases from brick-and-mortar stores is\nunder way.\n More than 500 consumer electronic stores closed in the past year alone, \nEbel said.\nIn response to this, BestBuy in the next 30 days will launch\nBestBuy.byair.com, a wireless shopping site. BestBuy's intention is to use\nits wireless site as another method to stay connected to its increasingly\nmobile customer base.\n In this age of geographic[ally] diverse individuals who travel and want to\nprovide gifts for family and friends, we believe Bestbuy.byair gives them a\nlocal feel,  Ebel said, adding that  The dot-com [component] is a wonderful\nmarketing tool. \nCurrently in development for BestBuy are personalized marketing initiatives\nto alert customers to products and services, and the company also is\ninvestigating location-based marketing via global positioning technology\nsoon to be in all cell phones.\nTechnology and marketing partners include Microsoft, which bought slightly\nless than 2 percent of BestBuy's equity for $200 million. ASP (application\nservice provider) GWCom will manage the wireless part of BestBuy's\ne-commerce activities, and AvocadoIT will supply the HTML to WML (Wireless\nMarkup Language) for WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) technology.\nAnd these companies are not the only ones looking to increase the face time\nwith their current customer base. GGP will launch its Mallibu.com site later\nthis month.\nChicago-based GGP has 136 properties in 36 states with 35 million visitors\nper year (almost 20 percent of the U.S. population), and a market cap of $8\nbillion. Nevertheless, company officials believe that m-commerce is\nessential to the company's long-term supremacy, according to Charlie Graves,\nsenior vice president for e-business at GGP.\nDuring the next year, GGP will roll out an increasingly robust site that\nwill include a Web site for every store in its malls. It will incorporate a\nlogistics component that includes an e-commerce drive-through for pickup of\nonline orders.\nThe wireless component is a key part of the initiative, Graves said.\n Because of the way malls are built with concrete and steel, you cannot get\na wireless signal in our properties. With microcells, I can program the\nmessaging in my world, specific to my mall. I can localize it tightly to\nflash an instant coupon, for example,  Graves said.\nGraves also sees the benefits of mobile commerce.\n We have shoppers coming to a mall 50 times a year, and I don't even know\ntheir names. Now we can market to them exactly what they want when they want\nit,  Graves said.\nBy 2004 there will be 1 billion cell phones worldwide, according to IDC, and\nhalf of them will be Internet-enabled.\nIn the travel world, Rosemont, Ill.-based Galileo, one of the four major\nreservation system companies, will be rolling out its mobile service to\ncorporate travel departments and travel agents later this year. Users will\nbe able to make and change flights reservation using their cell phones and\nbook rental cars and hotel rooms.\nOne industry analyst believes corporate agents will jump on the service as a\nway to keep track of changes made by its employees.\n Travelers tend to be cowboys who change their trips while they are\ntraveling. The Galileo system updates the corporate agency of any changes\nthe traveler makes and can be used to steer employees to preferred\ncarriers,  said Kate Rice, director of information services at Phocus\nWright, in Sherman, Conn.\nIn addition, tracking employee or department travel expenditures is helpful\nduring budget negotiations, Rice said.\nBut as these established brick-and-mortars stake their m-commerce claim,\nthey will face competition from pure-play Internet companies trying to\ndisplace them with their own mobile-commerce initiatives. One of those\ncompanies, VirtualBank, is expected to target high-tech companies that have\nprivate-label financial services with the first business-to-employee deals\nsigned with Compaq, storage giant EMC, and diversified company Textron.\nMeanwhile, some of the largest European banks are working with Compaq\nspin-off Tantau to deploy its mobile services platform in a partnership with\nHewlett-Packard. SE Banken of Sweden expects to have 5 million customers\nonline within three years, and Merita Bank, in Helsinki, Finland, is\nwrapping up a pilot with Tantau and expects 250,000 wireless banking\ncustomers by the end of the year.\n M-commerce will have a profound effect on the financial services industry, \nsaid Rory Brown, CEO of VirtualBank, a pure-play start-up with $40 million\nof backing from General Electric, Nokia, and DaimlerChrysler, plus a private\nplacement of funds from MCIWorldCom senior executives including CEO Bernie\nEbbers.\nBrown points out that Bank of America supports 10,000 physical locations and\nCharles Schwab, with an increasingly productive e-commerce site, has only\n400.\n If you look at the cost of a bank, a brick-and-mortar facility is holding\non to a commodity which they earn no money on. Half of it is handed out to\npeople, and the cash on hand is earning no money,  Brown said.\n____________________________", "output": "Ephraim Schwartz - Person Name, June 16,2000 - Date, http://www.idgnet.com/crd_idgsearch_0.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Einfoworld%\n2Ecom%2Farticles%2Fhn%2Fxml%2F00%2F06%2F19%2F000619hnmcommerce%2Exml&sc=4375\n5159_129872 - URL, electronics retailer BestBuy, shopping mall owner General Growth\nProperties (GGP), and reservation system Galileo - Organizations, Kelly\nQuinn - Person Name, Aberdeen Group, in Boston. - Organizations, Mark Ebel - Person Name, Minneapolis-based BestBuy - Organizations, United States - Location, Ebel - Person Name, BestBuy - Organizations, BestBuy - Organizations, Ebel - Person Name, BestBuy - Organizations, Microsoft, - Organizations, GWCom - Organizations, AvocadoIT - Organizations, GGP - Organizations, Chicago-based GGP - Organizations, Charlie Graves, - Person Name, GGP - Organizations, GGP - Organizations, Graves - Person Name, Graves - Person Name, Graves - Person Name, Graves - Person Name, Rosemont, Ill.-based Galileo - Organizations, Kate Rice - Person Name, Phocus\nWright, in Sherman, Conn. - Organizations, Rice - Person Name, VirtualBank - Organizations, Compaq, storage giant EMC, and diversified company Textron. - Organizations, Compaq\nspin-off Tantau - Organizations, Hewlett-Packard - Organizations, SE Banken of Sweden - Organizations, Merita Bank, in Helsinki, Finland - Organizations, Rory Brown - Person Name, General Electric, Nokia, and DaimlerChrysler, - Organizations, Bernie\nEbbers. - Person Name, Brown - Person Name, Bank of America - Organizations, Charles Schwab - Organizations, Brown - Person Name"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "id WG976L87; Wed, 9 Jan 2002 03:11:25 -0800\nby mailer.avocadoit.com (8.11.3/8.11.3) with SMTP id g09B5Ow23349\nfor <amy.moore@avocadoit.com>; Wed, 9 Jan 2002 03:05:24 -0800\nReply-to: instyle.com@instyle.m0.net\nErrors-to: instyle.com@instyle.m0.net\nMime-Version: 1.0\nX-cid: 5191515480\n-----=_NEXT_eb4aeb46d6\n-----=_NEXT_eb4aeb46d6\n-----=_NEXT_eb4aeb46d6--\nInStyle.com\nDear Amy,\nWelcome to a whole new year of new styles, stars, fashion and beauty at InStyle.com!\nSJP from A to Z\nLyrical Look\nSmoldering Lids\nRevlon\nWin a Revlon Gift Basket\nTell Revlon about someone who has  energized  or  refreshed  your life in 100 words or less and enter to win one of three Revlon gift baskets - valued at over $400 each!\nSkinlightsTM at Sundance Glistening glosses.

Out of all of the billions of people who live in the world, there has got to be somebody born on each date of the year. We are going to try to accomplish the task of seeing if we can fill the calendar up with a birthday on every day of the year. Add your first name (last optional) and your city and state next to your birth date to the list below. Then send this list to all of your friends, plus the person who sent it to you! Let's see if we can do it!!!! Remember, COPYING and PASTING this to NEW Email will keep it clean and make it easier to read than just forwarding it.(You can hit forward, but remove all addresses until you get to the start of this paragraph). If someone has already put their name in the slot of your birthday please just add your name beside and DO NOT DELETE THAT PERSON'S NAME!!!\nThanks and HAPPY BIRTHDAY.....\nJan. 1~ NEW YEARS BABY:Natasha.H(Chilliwack,BC)\nJan. 2~ Rick (AZ)\nJan. 3~ Hanna (Australia), Stephanie (WA), LindseyKohout(MI)\nJan. 4~ Linda (OH) Harold Steinbaugh,deceased, Lodi, CA\nJan. 5~ Krista (Corvallis, OR, USA)HollyF.(Cda)\nJan. 6~ Marley (Roseville, CA)\nJan. 7~\nJan. 8~ Jeff (So.Bend, IN)Bev(Halifax,N.S.)\nJan. 9~ Jennifer (Pgh, PA, USA) Chelsea(Elkhart,IN)\nJan. 10~ Nicole Busch(Westland, Mi.

He was issued a contractor's badge, and had apparently been wandering around up for here for a while.\nFirst of all, this guy is a vendor/visitor, and not an AvocadoIT contractor.  It concerns me that this guy was given a contractor's badge that allowed him access into the AvocadoIT general office area.  He should have been issued a visitor's badge, and the security person downstairs in the lobby should have contacted the AvocadoIT employee to come down and meet him.\nWe will let the security person in the lobby know ahead of time if we expect to have a contractor working up here in our office for any length of time.  Anyone else should be treated as a visitor, and not be issued a contractor's badge that allows them unescorted access to AvocadoIT's offices.\nCan you please see what you can do to prevent this from happening again in the future?

Do you feel good about yourself? Do you look happy? Those qualities attract people faster than anything. One of the keys to happiness is being active. Exercise pumps you full of endorphins, your body's natural opiate. When you get your blood flowing, you'll glow from the inside out. Want more good news? Exercise doesn't just mean calisthenics anymore. Walking to the store, biking to work, and tossing a Frisbee can all make you happier, fitter, and firmer. Getting active relieves stress and helps protect you from disease. So toss out that remote for a week and get out there! Real life's much more enriching.\nPass it on!\nSome days it's just hard to put an outfit together. But not if you know the inner style that's lurking inside you. Take Emode's What's Your Celebrity Look? test to find out if you're dressing right for the real you. Should you be wearing clothes that accentuate your casual, sporty, Meg Ryan-ness, or should you be matching Gwyneth's perfectly, put-together finesse? Make sure to send the test to friends, and family too. Who knows, the results just might give you reason to look into a whole new wardrobe.\nTake a new tone\nLet's face it, being healthy is one of the only fads that's never out of fashion. If you're not with the program yet, it's time for a fitness makeover. Tennis, inline skating, walking\u2014those are all great ways to get more active. Check out eDiets for tips on what to toss and what to keep in your fridge. They'll give you advice on how to build more muscle, lose more fat and feel on top of your game\u2014whatever it is.

Then It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life, is the next book for your must-read list. Raised by his single mom, Lance Armstrong had been active his entire life. By the time this Texas teen was in high school he was already an established triathlete and was training for the chance of a cycling career. After years of sacrifice, he was competing with the most elite racers on the professional tour\u2014that is, until he came up against his most formidable challenger ever, cancer.\nArmstrong's memoir is much more than a story about an athlete conquering an obstacle to reach a goal. His is an inspirational account of how one person learned to push beyond his limits, not as an athlete, but as a man trying to save his own life and a future for his family. Now that he's won his third consecutive Tour de France, it's a great time to learn more about Armstrong's fascinating life.\nGet up and go\nYou probably lead an active life already, but there are always new ways to go high profile. Here's the problem: It's easy to get sucked into your own little world when you collapse at home for some downtime. But how are you going to know what's going on if you leave conversation up to you and your armchair? Here's the solution: Find a friend and take a class you'll find physically or mentally challenging. If you bring your designated partner to each activity, you'll be more likely to make an impact and more likely to succeed. (There is something to that sense of friendly competition.) So start learning a new language, tackle rock climbing, or enroll in a photography class. If nothing else, it will give you great things to talk about at your next gathering. And at the very most, the shared experience of learning with a friend will probably have a positive effect on you.

But when Carol Hutton, author of Eternal Journey, took off for The Vineyard one chilly November, she was retreating to cope with the death of her dearest friend from breast cancer. As a psychologist, Hutton is accustomed to listening closely to others, but perhaps not to herself. Her book, Eternal Journey, chronicles the soul searching she starts while on the island. It is there that she meets the man who teaches her more than she ever imagined\u2014about life, death, the spirit of friendship, and love. This book is an intense, emotional journey; it will teach you how important introspection is to living a full life.\nExpand your network\nIt's important to you to be a good friend, but can you say the same thing about all the people in your life?

Invite a fringe friend to tag along to your favorite yoga class. Have your best friend read something you've recently read or written that expresses you in some way.

Beats Earnings Expectations\nBy MAY WONG\nAP Technology Writer\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Third-quarter earnings at Internet giant Yahoo! Inc. [NasdaqNM: YHOO - news] slipped past Wall Street expectations, helped by a 90 percent increase in revenues.\nFor the three months ended Sept. 30, Yahoo earned $47.6 million, or 8 cents per share, up from $11.1 million, or 2 cents a share.\nExcluding several items, including acquisition-related charges and equity investments, Yahoo posted pro forma earnings of $81.1 million, or 13 cents per share.\nAnalysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected earnings of 12 cents per share.\nShares of Yahoo, which finished regular trading down $3.06 to $82.69 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, shot back up to $84.91 during the after-hours session.\n``The global Yahoo franchise is stronger today than ever before, and this is reflected in our performance this quarter,'' said Tim Koogle, chairman and chief executive officer of Yahoo.\nRevenue for the quarter nearly doubled, jumping to $295.5 million from $155.9 million in the year-ago period.\nYahoo also said September traffic rose to 780 million page views a day, up from an average of 680 million page views a day in June.\nYahoo's earnings reports often are eagerly awaited because the company has consistently outperformed expectations and it is one of the few ``blue-chip'' Internet firms that have turned a profit.\nBut with many Internet companies slashing their marketing budgets or simply calling it quits, investors were looking at Yahoo's online ad revenues as a reflection of the health of the Internet industry.\nFor the nine months ended Sept. 30, Yahoo earned $168.6 million on revenue of $799 million. That compared with earnings of $10 million on revenue of $388 million.\n*\t^--------=\n*\tOn the Net:\n*\thttp://www.yahoo.com\nEmail this story - View most popular stories emailed\n_____\nMore Quotes and News:\t Yahoo Inc (NasdaqNM: YHOO - news)\nRelated News Categories: computers, ISDEX\n_____\nHelp\n_____\n_____\nCopyright \u00a9 2000 Yahoo!

Wireless IT was\nattended by over three times as many individuals this year over last and the\nfloor space for next year is already 50% sold out.\nHere's a look at the BUZZ From the Convention Floor\u2026\nVC See?\nThere is too much VC money out there, according to many of the attendees I\nspoke with. The joke about being one of 60 companies exhibiting at the show\ndoing the same thing is no joke. Greedy investors, flush from big Internet\nwins, are pouring money into me-too wireless ideas. While the heads of these\ncompanies are all looking to be bought soon, despite protestations to the\ncontrary about building a sustainable business, they are doing themselves a\ndisservice by not partnering now with other small companies. When the market\nis saturated in 6 months and the money dries up, the remnants could be\nscooped up and combined by Vulture Capitalists. Better to do it yourself now\nand hedge your bets.\nAvocadoIT: The MSFT of Wireless\nEverybody in the valley has an I hate Microsoft story. AvocadoIT is getting\na similar rep among start-ups. Success breeds contempt.\nCritics claim AvocadoIT has no sustainable technology, few paying customers\nand a decreasing client list. PR reps and company spokespeople will\ntell you different, but what really counts is the word on the street. One\nbrazen CEO claimed if AvocadoIT had any smarts, they'd buy his company to\nget some real technology. Sort of a reverse merger into IPO. Needless to\nsay, the CEO wasn't selling, and it's doubtful that Venk is buying.\nIronically, though, much of the competition is hoping these early movers\nshake this pre-IPO malaise. If AvocadoIT leads the wireless application\ncompanies to the public markets and fails, it's bad news for everybody in\nthe industry.\nBest Pairing for Celebrity Death Match\nThe Giant Bear bear and the Zucotto chef. The two most ubiquitous show-floor\n figures  should get themselves a cage match at the next WWF SmackDown.\nThere's a fine line between cute and annoying and both companies crossed it.\nOverheard in the Nokia booth:\n Is the Giant Bear bear a guy or a chick? \n Why, did it grab your behind?

We should not treat this as a one-shot to do for a customer.\nI think that we can address Juniper's requirement if we enhance the EMAS\nto support handling XML-based requests.  This is different from  XML\ndatafeed  since that was just a variant on our basic transcoding\ncapability.  What I mean by an XML-based request is one in which both\nthe content as well as the request handling semantics are encoded in\nXML.  Encoded content could be validated via a shared DTD.  Encoded\nrequest handling semantics need not be DOM based at all (i.e. don't\nrequire a DTD because they are parsed using an XML SAX parser).\nThe important thing here is how complicated a module we need to build in\norder to develop this capability.  We don't want to write any code to\ninterpret or understand something as variable as business logic or\napplication-specific content.  XML is perfect for encoding business\nlogic and structuring content.  Our code simply needs to be able to be\nhanded either an XML document or an XML doc plus DTD and read them for\ninstructions.  Handling new types of information or request types should\ninvolve adding new data files (XML docs or DTDs) and never new code to\nthe EMAS.\nThere is a very rich open source community which has developed around\nXML, and we should take advantage of all the tools and standards which\nare offered.  Here are some URLs to go to for a start:\nhttp://www.w3.org/XML  -- The main page for XML activities within W3C\nhttp://www.w3.org/XML/Query -- The XML Query standard and working group\npapers\nhttp://www.java.sun.com/xml -- Java XML support (APIs and products)\nhttp://www.apache.org/xml -- The Apache XML projects, including\nbest-of-breed XML parsers (these are awesome!!!)\nI'm sure that some of you DBMS gurus know of pointers which are\nspecifically tailored to XML/DBMS interfaces -- let's try to leverage\nthese too.\nMy goal is to insure that everything we add to the EMAS will evolve the\npermanent baseline for our server.  Our customers and our competition\nall are leveraging XML; we must also make maximum use of this valuable\ntool in order to stay in a leadership position.\n-- Sheri", "output": "http://www.w3.org/XML - URL, http://www.w3.org/XML/Query - URL, http://www.java.sun.com/xml - URL, http://www.apache.org/xml - URL, Sheri - Person Name"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "2,500 Mobile Consultants\nFirst of all, I'm assuming that these people's bandwidth is small, and they either use a lot of their time on administrative tasks or by using administrative support people to handle:\n1) Billing\n2) Travel\n3) Expenses\n4) Project Management (updating timelines, etc.)\nI have all the players at Peoplesoft.

His name was Kyle.  It looked like he was\ncarrying all of his books. I thought to myself,  Why would anyone bring come\nall his books on a Friday? He must really be a nerd.   I had quite a weekend\nplanned (parties and a football game with my friends tomorrow afternoon), so\nI shrugged my shoulders and went on As I was walking, I saw a bunch of kids\nrunning toward him. They ran at him, knocking all his books out of his arms\nand tripping him so he landed in the dirt. His glasses went flying, and I\nsaw them land in the grass about ten feet from him. He looked up and I saw\nthis terrible sadness in his eyes. My heart went out to him. So, I jogged\nover to him and as he crawled around looking for his glasses, and I saw a\ntear in his eye. As I handed him his glasses, I said,  Those guys are jerks.\nThey really should get lives.  He looked at me and said,  Hey thanks!  There\nwas a big s!\nmile on his face. It was one of those smiles that showed real gratitude. I\nhelped him pick up his books, and asked him where he lived. As it turned\nout, he lived near me, so I asked him why I had never seen him before. He\nsaid he had gone to private school before now. I would have never hung out\nwith a private school kid before. We talked all the way home, and I carried\nsome of his books. He turned out to be a pretty cool kid. I asked him if he\nwanted to play a little football with my friends. He said yes. We hung out\nall weekend and the more I got to know Kyle, the more I liked him, and my\nfriends thought the same of him. Monday morning came, and there was Kyle\nwith the huge stack of books again. I stopped him and said,  Boy, you are\ngonna really build some serious muscles with this pile of books everyday! \nHe just laughed and handed me half the books.\nOver the next four years, Kyle and I became best friends. When we were\nseniors, we began to think about college. Kyle decided on Georgetown, and I\nwas going to Duke. I knew that we would always be friends, that the miles\nwould never be a problem. He was going to be a doctor, and I was going for\nbusiness on a football scholarship. Kyle was valedictorian of our class. I\nteased him all the time about being a nerd. He had to prepare a speech for\ngraduation. I was so glad it wasn't me having to get up there and speak.\nGraduation day, I saw Kyle. He looked great. He was one of those guys that\nreally found himself during high school. He filled out and actually looked\ngood in glasses. He had more dates than I had and all the girls loved him.\nBoy, sometimes I was jealous. Today was one of those  days. I could see that\nhe was nervous about his speech. So, I smacked him on the back and said,\n Hey, big guy, you'll be great!  He looked at me with one of those looks\n(the really grateful one) and smiled.  Thanks,  he said.\nAs he started his speech, he cleared his throat, and began.  Graduation\nis a time to thank those who helped you make it through those tough years.\nYour parents, your teachers, your siblings, maybe a coach...but mostly your\nfriends. I am here to tell all of you that being a friend to someone is the\nbest gift you can give them. I am going to tell you a story.  I just looked\nat my friend with disbelief as he told the story of the first day we met.\nHe had planned to kill himself over the weekend. He talked of how he had\ncleaned out his locker so his Mom wouldn't have to do it later and was\ncarrying his stuff home. He looked hard at me and gave me a little smile.\n Thankfully, I was saved.  My friend saved me from doing the unspeakable.  I\nheard the gasp go through the crowd as this handsome, popular boy told us\nall about his weakest moment. I saw his Mom and dad looking at me and\nsmiling that same grateful smile. Not until the moment did I realize it's\ndepth.\nNever underestimate the power of your actions. With one small gesture\nyou can change a person's life. For better or for worse. God puts us all in\nYou now have two choices, you can:\n1) Pass this on to your friends or\n2) Delete it and act like it didn't touch your heart.\nAs you can see, I took choice number 1.  Friends are angels who lift us to\nour feet when our wings have trouble remembering how to fly. \nThere is no beginning or end.. Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is mystery.\nToday is a gift.\nShow your friends how much you care.  Send this to everyone you consider a\nFRIEND. If it comes back to you, then you'll know you have a circle of\nfriends.\nWHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS LETTER, YOU'RE REQUESTED TO SEND IT TO AT LEAST 10\nPEOPLE, INCLUDING THE PERSON WHO SENT IT TO YOU.", "output": "Kyle - Person Name,  Kyle - Person Name, Kyle - Person Name, Kyle - Person Name, Georgetown - Location, Duke - Location, Kyle - Person Name, Kyle - Person Name"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "id Y22LR736; Tue, 12 Dec 2000 12:25:04 -0800\nby mailer.avocadoit.com (8.10.2/8.10.2) with SMTP id eBCK5dD11280\nfor <amy.moore@avocadoit.com>; Tue, 12 Dec 2000 12:05:39 -0800\n(InterMail vM.4.01.03.00 201-229-121) with SMTP\nid <20001212201120.GJIM25417.mail1.rdc3.on.home.com@cr224419A>\nfor <amy.moore@avocadoit.com>; Tue, 12 Dec 2000 12:11:20 -0800\nOrganization: Faircloth Group\nboundary= ----=_NextPart_000_0279_01C0644C.FDED18C0 \nX-MSMail-Priority: High\nX-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V5.50.4133.2400\nThis is a multi-part message in MIME format.\n------=_NextPart_000_0279_01C0644C.FDED18C0\nboundary= ----=_NextPart_001_027A_01C0644C.FDED18C0 \n------=_NextPart_001_027A_01C0644C.FDED18C0\ncharset= iso-8859-1 \n------=_NextPart_001_027A_01C0644C.FDED18C0\ncharset= iso-8859-1 \n------=_NextPart_001_027A_01C0644C.FDED18C0--\n------=_NextPart_000_0279_01C0644C.FDED18C0\nname= Rogerbio1.doc \nContent-Disposition: attachment;\nfilename= Rogerbio1.doc \n------=_NextPart_000_0279_01C0644C.FDED18C0--\nAs a follow up to my phone conversation and interest in speaking with Venktesh Shukla about AvocadoIT and the Canadian market attached a profile of my background.\nMy focus for the last five years has been CRM and the web, and currently the North American wireless market.

The joke about being one of 60 companies exhibiting at the\nshow\ndoing the same thing is no joke. Greedy investors, flush from big\nInternet\nwins, are pouring money into me-too wireless ideas. While the heads of\nthese\ncompanies are all looking to be bought soon, despite protestations to\nthe\ncontrary about building a sustainable business, they are doing\nthemselves a\ndisservice by not partnering now with other small companies. When the\nmarket\nis saturated in 6 months and the money dries up, the remnants could be\nscooped up and combined by Vulture Capitalists. Better to do it yourself\nnow\nand hedge your bets.\nAvocadoIT: The MSFT of Wireless\nEverybody in the valley has an I hate Microsoft story. AvocadoIT is\ngetting\na similar rep among start-ups. Success breeds contempt.\nCritics claim AvocadoIT has no sustainable technology, few paying\ncustomers\nand a decreasing client list. PR reps and company spokespeople will\ntell you different, but what really counts is the word on the street.\nOne\nbrazen CEO claimed if AvocadoIT had any smarts, they'd buy his company\nto\nget some real technology. Sort of a reverse merger into IPO. Needless to\nsay, the CEO wasn't selling, and it's doubtful that Venk is buying.\nIronically, though, much of the competition is hoping these early movers\nshake this pre-IPO malaise. If AvocadoIT leads the wireless application\ncompanies to the public markets and fails, it's bad news for everybody\nin\nthe industry.\nBest Pairing for Celebrity Death Match\nThe Giant Bear bear and the Zucotto chef.

But, this approach will give us a much more easier way to penetrate the market like BEA does with their high end app. servers. The implication is that the  average deal size may be lower.

(VENTUREWIRE) -- Ants.com, a developer of technology that keeps address books up to date and an operator of an online marketplace for freelancers, said it has acquired the rights to the customers of Zkey, an identity and personal information management company. Zkey, which is changing its business model, said it will shut down its portal of free Web-based personal information applications to focus on licensing its intelligent mobile transactions software to wireless carriers and mobile service providers. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. As part of the deal, Ants.com will have the potential to add 300,000 registered Zkey users to Scout, its automated tool that manages electronic address books on PCs. Ants.com, which began as a marketplace for freelance workers and employers, launched Scout, its address book management product, in February. A company spokesperson said that while Ants.com would continue to operate the freelance end of the business, its main focus is now the address book technology. Ants.com also said that Nick Desai, CEO of Zkey, will join the Ants.com board of advisers.

Forty nine percent of those were interested in an e-mail-ready phone.\n The bottom line is that things are shifting more to convenience,  says Geoffrey Koontz, a wireless analyst for the Strategis Group.

Also note the focus on the hip new wireless publication, Unstrung. (Venk had lunch with the editor of Unstrung recently during a trip to NY.)\n------\nWireless Internet Making New York Home\nBy SIMON ROMERO\nAugust 21, 2000, New York Times\nAter the plates of spicy raw tuna and wasabi-crusted tofu were cleared from\nthe table of a Greenwich Village restaurant one recent evening, discussion\nturned to probably the hottest topic among New York entrepreneurs these\ndays: the wireless Internet.\n Where's the talent?  asked Tyler Daines, a venture capitalist who is\nbacking a wireless Web start-up with offices in Manhattan and Helsinki.\n Where's the killer app?  asked Gordon Gould, chief executive of a mobile\ncommunications company.\n Why isn't this discussion taking place in California?  asked Andrew\nSeybold, a Silicon Valley wireless consultant and industry-newsletter\npublisher.\nThe answer to all these questions lies in New York, which is emerging as the\nnation's center for wireless Internet applications, financing and\nadvertising. Eager to expunge the dot-com taint -- the volatile stock\nvaluations based on questionable, pure-play Internet business models -- much\nof Silicon Alley is recasting itself in a wireless role.\nThere is even a new buzzword to describe the scene:  unstrung. \nThe unstrung are undaunted by some experts' gloomy forecasts that the\nwireless Internet might never live up to its billing if users are turned off\nby the current, bland offerings of e-mail or sports scores, served up as\nscanty lines of text on the tiny screens of cellular phones and other mobile\ndevices.\nUndeterred, more than two dozen New York wireless Internet companies have\nbeen created in the last year or so. The rookie lineup includes Savos, which\ndelivers Internet music and other Web-based audio to mobile phones;\nSmartRay, a portal seeking to be the wireless Yahoo, and Upoc, which focuses\non Internet text-messaging services intended for young wireless phone\nenthusiasts.\nThe West Coast remains the locus of wireless technology development. And\nthere are many more wireless Internet services and applications already up\nand running in Europe -- eagerly embraced by people weary of balky wired\ntelephone networks. But it is New York that has become the fertile breeding\nground for new uses and services through wireless hand-held devices.\nPart of the impetus is geographic.  Manhattan has the potential to be the\ncenter of deals between the U.S. and Europe, where the wireless phenomenon\nis much stronger,  said Mark Caron, chief executive of MobileSpring, a\nso-called incubator company in New York that is focused on wireless\nstart-ups. What's more, he said,  the level of creativity here is\nunequaled. \nAnd then, of course, there is New York's standing as a major money center. A\nhost of financiers with operations in New York are focusing on the wireless\nInternet, with big players including Flatiron Partners, a venture capital\nfirm that has had ties with Chase Manhattan and Softbank of Japan. Others,\nlike Nokia Venture Partners, the investment arm of the Finnish mobile phone\ngiant Nokia, are preparing to set up New York offices.\n New York is getting hot very quickly,  said Tom Kenney, a principal at\nNokia Venture Partners, who plans to move the firm's East Coast base to New\nYork from Washington.\nThe field is so new and so much in flux that no one pretends to have firm\nfigures on investments, jobs created or even the number of new wireless\nInternet companies in New York. But many with money agree that the mobile\nInternet is one of the few Net-related areas that continues to solicit\nstrong interest among entrepreneurs and investors.\n We were among the first to carve out a space in the area,  said Seth\nGoldstein of Flatiron Partners.\nThe New York wireless scene is buzzing, so much so that an online magazine\nhas been created to cover it all: the magazine, Unstrung, seeks to blend the\nsophistication of Wallpaper, an architecture and design magazine, with the\nattention to detail of trade publications like Wireless Week. Unstrung's\nmotto is  tied to nothing but the future. \n We're on the cusp where the kids in sandals at the dot-coms are turning\ntheir attention to wireless,  said Josh Newman, a former schoolteacher in\nthe South Bronx, who help found Unstrung and serves as its top editor.  The\nopportunity to cover this potentially huge niche was looking us right in the\nface. \nStoking Mr. Newman's hope that Unstrung can hit it big was a panel\ndiscussion about the wireless Internet last month held by the New York New\nMedia Association at N.Y.U. The event's organizers had to turn away about\n200 people after the crowd reached the fire marshal's limit of 1,100.\nMany were employees at Silicon Alley dot-coms who were hoping to learn more\nabout what was being touted as the next big thing. A good many others were\nfrom other walks of life -- just curious about a subject that true believers\ndiscuss with equal parts grandeur and jargon. ( Talk spurt  and\n location-based services  are two favorites in the unstrung lexicon.)\nSome people in New York's wireless Internet scene, think that the buzz\nsurrounding the young industry -- including the verbiage -- is risky.\n We're concerned that the hype level, combined with the lack of knowledge\nabout the limitations of the wireless Internet, could turn people off in the\nsame way pure Internet plays are falling out of favor,  said Brian Bodell,\nhead of marketing strategies at Mobile Metrics, a company providing\nadvertising services for wireless users.  That's why you rarely see a\nwireless Internet company with a dot-com in their name and why many\ncompanies want to show they're not betting all their chips on wireless. \nBut certainly some established Silicon Alley Web development companies see\nadvantages in having a stake in wireless. For instance, Razorfish and\nAgency.com, two players with international reach that help companies develop\nand roll out their Web operations, are expanding their New York wireless\noperations.\n Until six or eight weeks ago, we had no concrete wireless plans for North\nAmerica  said David Eastman, Agency's head of mobile business for Europe,\nduring a recent trip to New York.  But now, we're ready to promote a\nknowledge bleed from London to New York because this is where the action\nis. \nAmong the pure-play mobile Internet start-ups, New York's best known so far\nmay be Vindigo, which provides maps and information from publications like\nthe Zagat restaurant guides, for use on Palm hand-helds and other portable\ndevices.\nThe service is not yet a true wireless Internet application, because users\nmust download the material through a standard, land-line Internet\nconnection. But the information is formatted for relatively easy searching\nand reading on a hand-held device, and the company plans to offer wireless\nupdating as network technology evolves.\nNearly 100,000 people have downloaded the company's city guides in six\nmonths in New York and four other urban regions, making Vindigo one of the\nfirst applications of its kind to show potential of spreading  virally  --\nby word of mouth, or mouse -- and with little formal advertising.\n We're creating the technology which will allow content providers to extend\ntheir brand to the wireless realm,  said Jason Devitt, 31, who left a job\nselling derivatives at D. E. Shaw, a technology-focused investment bank, to\nbecome Vindigo's chief executive last year.\n Look around,  Mr. Devitt said, pointing to the frenzied activity in\nVindigo's disheveled headquarters in a gutted building in the garment\ndistrict.  We have no time to pause and think about whether we're going to\nbe a big part of the location-based services segment because we're already\nthere. \nWhile Vindigo offers a glimpse of an industry poised for takeoff, most\nwireless Internet companies in New York are in the early stages of\ndevelopment --  stealth mode,  as people familiar with the start-ups put it.\nFew have advanced beyond the first stages of financing provided by venture\ncapitalists.\nStill, the sense that new applications can evolve well beyond stock quotes\nor short e-mail has some people believing that local companies have a bright\nfuture.\nTim Connolly, director of Ericsson CyberLab, a research and development\ncompany set up in New York's financial district by the Swedish\ntelecommunications giant Ericsson, said that  with the mobile Internet, it\nseems the transition from technology to services is happening faster than it\nhappened on the Web, and thus the services focus that New York has plays a\nlarge role. \nTo be sure, the advantage of being close to the television, publishing,\ntelecommunications and financial industries of New York is a lure for anyone\nseeking to hop on the wireless Internet bandwagon.\nBut given the industry's current limitations, there is a chance that\ncompanies focusing on applications for the wireless Internet might be in for\nthe rough road traveled by many a struggling content provider for the\nhard-wired Web.\nAfter all, there are two definitions of  unstrung  in the American Heritage\nConcise Dictionary. One is  having the strings loosened or removed.  The\nother is  emotionally upset.

This month, we are delighted to introduce you to some of the features of MyPalm, as well as to a new member of the Palm family. Read on to learn more on a number of MyPalm features that you might be interested in getting to know better!\nRemember Your Valentine!\nTop\nIf you forget your sweetie on Valentine's Day, you might be looking forward to a night in the doghouse! Don't play the love fool -- use MyPalm calendar to remind yourself to arrange something special for your significant other on February 14th. Add a reminder to your calendar to make dinner reservations, buy flowers or ask your sweetheart's mom about his or her favorite meal. To add a reminder, select Add Reminder from the drop-down menu in the upper right hand corner of your MyPalm calendar.\nEspecially for Palm\u2122 VII Handheld Owners\nTop\nMyPalm is not just for the Web anymore! If you are a Palm VII or Palm VIIx handheld owner, you can access MyPalm wirelessly with the Beta version of the MyPalm Web Clipping Application. By downloading the MyPalm Web Clipping App, you can wirelessly update your Date Book, access other web clipping applications, search and browse the Internet, check movie times in your area and more -- the application is FREE to download, too!\nWelcoming WeSync\nTop\nOn December 20th, Palm announced its intent to acquire WeSync, a leader in the development of group and wireless synchronization solutions. As part of the acquisition, MyPalm members can expect valuable aspects of the WeSync services to be integrated with MyPalm, offering more flexibility to share information in groups and to update your information via the Web, wirelessly, and from more than two organizers at once. We're very excited by the prospect of welcoming WeSync to the Palm family -- for more information on the acquisition, please see the official press release.\nPuppy Love\nTop\nCarole K. of California uses MyPalm for a very special cause. As the coordinator for  Pet Pals,  a pet-assisted therapy group, she keeps the schedule of 28 volunteers and 30 dogs. In teams, the volunteers and their dogs visit local hospitals, nursing homes, elementary schools and a number of other places where people may need a dose of puppy love. Carole has set up a Group in MyPalm so that the volunteers can keep on top of their hairy schedules. Now that Carole no longer needs to call numerous volunteers and organizations for minor scheduling updates, she attests,  MyPalm has allowed me peace of mind. \nTell us how you are using MyPalm. If we use your story, we'll send you a free gift.\nIf you prefer not to receive future MyPalm newsletters, simply reply to this email with  unsubscribe  in the subject.\nBack to Top\n\u00a9 2000 Palm, Inc.

Can you please answer the questions and return the\nresponses to me by Wednesday, February 28th?  Please contact me if you have\nany questions.  Thanks in advance!\nWireless Security Report Topic:\nThe recent trend toward Internet-enabled wireless devices has prompted\nrapid growth of the mobile-commerce marketplace. In order for this market\nto really take off though, users must feel comfortable transferring\npersonal and financial information via the Internet. Wireless security will\nplay a central role in providing users this level of comfort. Check out\nthis article for the latest on new encryption algorithms and tools for\nsecuring the transfer of information via any wireless mobile device.\nQuestions:\n1. What is the name/title of respondent? Please list company affiliation as\nwell as company headquarters and web address.\n2. Why is security for mobile commerce such a big deal? Are user's personal\ninformation really at risk? Give examples where possible.\n3. What current encryption schemes/algorithms are used for securing the\nInternet?\n4. Will the evolution of the Wireless Internet drive these encryption\nschemes/algorithms to change? If so, how will they need to change?\n5. Please provide information on the security technology/tools that you\noffer. Include any relevant press releases and information on how the\ntechnology/tools can be used as well as why it is different from what other\ncompanies may offer. If possible, please include a graphic or two with\ncaptions that can be used to illustrate your technology/tools and/or how it\nworks. I CANNOT accept PowerPoint files as graphics. I CAN accept 300 dpi\nGIF, tiff, jpeg, or bmp files.\n6. In general, what do wireless system developers need to know about\nutilizing the technology/tools offered by your company or by other\ncompanies? For example, are there any trade-offs, design constraints or\nlimitations they will need to deal with?\n________________________\nRuben P.

It's Jody Delitche.  She has been so busy that she hasn't been doing anything with it.  I talked to her and she is going to try to pull a meeting together the week after next with the other people involved.  I'm not sure if this will be a good beta, given that it is an external site. Hey, just a thought now.  What if we somehow tried to link it to Fall Comdex in mid-November?   Probably too soon and we won't be able to support the Jornada Pocket PC but its worth a shot.

IT Insider by Ben Sullivan\nDell takes a pass on Itanium 2\nDell Computer says it's taking a wait-and-see approach to Intel's Itanium 2\nprocessor. The Round Rock, Texas-based PC maker will not be on hand when Intel\nunveils the new server CPU next week and says it has no plans to release a\nmachine based on the chip any time soon.\nhttp://www.comdex.com/sullivan.php\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n6. Opposing Views: Does the notebook surpass the desktop in fueling worker\nproductivity?\n What some consider personal computers' biggest benefit -- increased\nproductivity -- can be improved only by switching from a desktop to\na notebook computer ... Very few users do all of their work at their\ndesk. If computers make users more productive at their desks, why\ncan't computers make them more productive when they're working away\nfrom their desks? \n--David Berlind, tech columnist\n Problem #1 -- cost of service to replace, upgrade or repair.\nProblem #2 -- Theft. Laptops have legs. Problem #3 -- Service life.\nLaptops suffer from overheating when used 24x7 as a workstation and\ntheir lifetimes are significantly shorter than a comparable desktop unit.\nProblem #4 -- User software. It is very difficult to control the user\nsoftware installed and the conflicts that arise from unauthorized and\nuntested software. \n--Michael Peterson, in response to Berlind's column\nSource: CNET Networks, 2002\nSend ideas for consideration in  Opposing Views  to james.gillies@key3media.com\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n7.

The problem was because of cardlayout being used. I found some interesting information which I wanted to share with everybody. According to a link in Javasoft Forum,\nCardLayouts only set the bounds of their initial child component, but cause doLayout() to be invoked on all children. This causes children to lay themselves out with respect to a bounding rect of (0,0,0,0); if nested panels have inset borders, then bounds of children can go negative.\nEarlier it was always working for 'None' type and giving intermittent problems for others. Now I have done a change, that whenever I change the type, I remove all the components from cardlayout panel and add them again where the first component being added depends on the type. I have changed the code accordingly and tested it. It should fix bug 2377.

With this reement, as a first step in creating robust and scalable m-commerce solutions, TANTAU customers will have the ability to rapidly develop and deploy wireless applications based on their existing hypertext markup language (HTML) websites.\n Together, we are creating even more flexibility on an already strong mobile transaction foundation,  said Hjalti Thorarinsson, CEO of Dimon Software.  Building on a secure platform that is scalable to millions of users, TANTAU customers will now have a graphical prototyping and application development tool that will allow them to quickly provide an m-commerce solution that leverages their enterprises' wired assets. \nDimon's Waporizer 2.0 will be integrated into the Content Converter module of TANTAU's Wireless Internet Platform. The additional functionality will quickly and easily convert HTML content into extensible markup language (XML) content, and enhance the platform's ability to convert XML to mark-up languages supporting mobile Internet standards, such as WAP and i-Mode. These new capabilities will be integrated into TANTAU's extensible style sheet language (XSL) engine and will boost TANTAU's existing library of XSL style sheets to support a more comprehensive range of mobile devices. As a result, the combined solution will benefit from the scale and high performance characteristics of TANTAU's Wireless Internet Platform and is scheduled to be available in the first quarter of 2001.\n The integration of Dimon's transcoding technology into our Wireless Internet Platform gives our customers the necessary tools to quickly add a wireless channel to their existing online ecommerce system with very little effort,  said Peter Klante, vice president of marketing for TANTAU.  The resulting platform provides a fast and easy entry into the world of m-commerce and from there, enterprises can build an advanced mobile business. \nAbout Dimon's Waporizer\nBased on open standards, Waporizer 2.0 is a presentation management server that enables companies to publish content from databases, file systems, XML content management systems and other sources straight to any mobile Internet platform. Using the accompanying Waporizer Development Tool, web administrators can rapidly convert existing content assets straight from HTML and XML and other sources to a number of mobile Internet formats, including WML (WAP) and cHTML (i-mode). Waporizer features include SSL encryption for secure m-commerce, device specific delivery for optimal display on all handsets and an open API for 3rd party developers.\nAbout Dimon Software\nBased in Iceland, which holds the world record on wireless handsets per capita, Dimon's core competence is building software solutions for content delivery over the Internet based on Java, XML and XSL.

It provides a comparable in the experience with cellphones in general - take note sales team if dealing with wary customers (and G with the press).\nAlso, it provides some disappointing hard numbers on current usage in Europe. HOWEVER, this info seems contradictory given that I know people in London who have been unable to use their WAP phones on weeekends because of intense usage. Dan noted the same problem exists in Japan in the evenings.\nAs for uptake, in the States its at over 1MM - and projected to hit 2.5MM by year end.\nIt also comments on how fast access speeds will increase - not nearly as fast as the wireless OEMs and carriers claim. This is entirely consistent with what EVERY independent 3d party I've spoken to says. And the carriers will be much slower rolling out the new techs than they admit - but this is because they're building out the networks\nLastly, this article reinforces what the Marketing department has been saying since it was first established at AvocadoIT (take a bow Barry): that voice recognition and voice interactivity are the key developments that will take mobile internet far beyond its current confines\nRon\n.\nCity voices concern overslow take-up of the mobile internet\nSource: The Independent - London\nPublication date: 2000-08-03\nDOUGLAS ADAMS, the author of the bestselling Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy, might not seem the most obvious champion of internet- enabled mobile phones but he is billed in precisely this way in the latest issue of Time magazine.\nA profile of the author's new internet venture, an online guide called h2g2, recalls that in his original book published in 1978 researchers and travellers roam the galaxy armed with mobile electronic devices, beaming in reviews which are instantly available for anybody to read. What was merely a narrative mechanism for Mr Adams has turned into reality thanks to internet-enabled mobile phones.\nNot that Mr Adams sees himself as a prophet.  I didn't foresee the internet,  he says.  But then neither did the computer industry. Not that that tells us very much of course - the computer industry didn't even foresee that the century was going to end. \nJoking aside, there is a danger that the dream of the much-hyped Wireless Application Protocol, is already turning sour. There have been a flurry of negative announcements in recent weeks which have suggested that consumers may be more reticent about adopting mobile internet technology than initial bullish projections suggested.\nLast week Nokia, the Finnish mobile phone maker, shocked the markets when it warned that handset sales would not be as strong as expected in its third quarter. The shares fell a further 3.9 per cent yesterday.\nOn Tuesday, UBS Warburg cuts its share price target for ARM Holdings, the chip designer, citing disappointing debuts for the next generation of mobile phones. This prompted an extraordinary response from ARM's chief financial officer, Jonathan Brooks.  We never thought these things were going to roll out quickly anyway,  he said.  I personally never thought WAP was going to be a big thing. \nThe mobile operating companies admit being disappointed with their WAP- connections so far. Orange claims it has about 80,000 WAP- enabled phones in use in the UK while BT Cellnet says it has 175,000 though many of these have been given away.\nIt is not just the UK that is uncertain. In Germany the auction of the third-generation mobile phone licences is proving a much more cautious affair than was the case in Britain with the total bids reaching DM4.8bn (pounds 1.5bn) by the end of yesterday's rounds. It is also understood that the average usage per active WAP-user on Vodafone's German subsidiary D2 is less than a minute a day, barely enough to dial up and then give up.\nWhat has gone wrong? The problems are similar to many new technologies where the reality does not quite live up to the hype. In the case of mobile internet, the phones are difficult to use, often unreliable and slow.\nEven Hans Snook, chief executive of Orange acknowledges that WAP- phones are far from perfect.  This is par for the course with new technologies,  he says  They tend to ramp up slowly, even if there is some hype from certain parties. There are always glitches and the technology is not as easy to use as people had hoped. We have seen this before with the first mobile phones in 1984-85. People were calling them the biggest white elephant we've ever seen. A year later everyone was saying what a great business it was to be in. It was the same with PCs and faxes. \nChristian Maher, a telecoms analyst at Investec Henderson Crosthwaite agrees.  It is like most new technologies. People hype it, then it tails off, and then it comes back. With mobile phones the market has always come back bigger and better than previously forecast. \nThe crunch will come early next year when the new GPRS networks begin operating offering phones whose internet access is  always on  thereby avoiding the need for slow dial-ups. This system was supposed to be able to download information 10 times quicker than current speeds. But more recent estimates have been much lower, suggesting just 2-3 times current speeds. Keith Woolcock, a technology analyst at Nomura International, says.  The speeds will not be anything like the forecasts unless you are stood rigid right next to a base station. The great dream of streamed multi-media will remain a dream. \nHans Snook says the mistake has been to compare mobile internet only with what the existing PC-based internet can do. He points to the development of voice recognition and voice interactivity as the key developments that will take mobile internet far beyond its current confines.  One day we'll be able to conduct transitions and get information via thought transfer,  he says, meaning you will be able to  think your commands into your mobile phone or PC without the use of a keyboard  Scientists are already working on this with some success. \nWAP's problem is that its potential is so great that initial experiences were destined to disappoint. While most technologies have a relatively long gestation period, usually measured in many years, WAP's development from concept to high street, has been compressed into a matter of months. As one analyst says;  WAP has always had to live in a goldfish bowl. It has had to do its growing up in public. \nEnabling Infrastructure for Post-PC Era\n************************************\nRon D Silverton\nDirector of Strategic Marketing\nAvocadoIT, Inc.\n3231 Scott Boulevard\nSanta Clara, CA  95054\nTel: 408.562.8039\nMobile: 415.845.6789\nFax:  408.562.8100\nrsilverton@avocadoit.com\n************************************", "output": "Europe - Location, London - Location, Dan - Person Name, Japan - Person Name, States - Location, AvocadoIT - Organizations, Barry - Person Name, Ron - Person Name, The Independent - London - Organizations, 2000-08-03 - Date, DOUGLAS ADAMS - Person Name, Time magazine - Brand Name, Mr Adams - Person Name, Mr Adams - Person Name, Nokia - Organizations, UBS Warburg - Organizations, ARM Holdings - Organizations, ARM' - Organizations, Jonathan Brooks - Person Name, Orange - Organizations, UK - Location, BT Cellnet - Organizations, UK - Location, Germany  - Location, Britain - Location, Vodafone's German subsidiary D2 - Organizations, Even Hans Snook - Person Name, Orange - Organizations, Investec - Organizations, Henderson Crosthwaite  - Person Name, Keith Woolcock - Person Name, Nomura International - Organizations, Hans Snook - Person Name, Ron D Silverton - Person Name, AvocadoIT, Inc.\n3231 Scott Boulevard\nSanta Clara, CA  95054 - Address, Tel: 408.562.8039\nMobile: 415.845.6789\nFax:  408.562.8100 - Phone Number, rsilverton@avocadoit.com - Email"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "URL accessed\nTime of test : 1.35 am PST            \t\t\t\t\tPass / Fail \tMessages\nhttps://10.4.4.12/servlet/EPServlet?opt=statistics     \t(statistics)\tpass\nhttps://10.4.4.12/servlet/EPServlet?opt=etradepda\t\t(pda)\t\tpass\nhttps://10.4.4.12/servlet/EPServlet?opt=etrade88456\t(smartphone)\tpass\nhttps://10.4.4.12/servlet/EPServlet?opt=etraderim\t\t(rim)\t\tpass\nhttps://10.4.4.14/servlet/EPServlet?opt=statistics     \t(statistics)\tpass\nhttps://10.4.4.14/servlet/EPServlet?opt=etradepda\t\t(pda)\t\tpass\nhttps://10.4.4.14/servlet/EPServlet?opt=etrade88456\t(smartphone)\tpass\nhttps://10.4.4.14/servlet/EPServlet?opt=etraderim\t\t(rim)\t\tpass\nhttps://10.4.4.6/servlet/EPServlet?opt=statistics     \t(statistics)\tpass\nhttps://10.4.4.6/servlet/EPServlet?opt=etradepda\t\t(pda)\t\tpass\nhttps://10.4.4.6/servlet/EPServlet?opt=etrade88456\t(smartphone)\tpass\nhttps://10.4.4.6/servlet/EPServlet?opt=etraderim\t\t(rim)\t\tpass\nhttps://10.4.4.10/servlet/EPServlet?opt=statistics     \t(statistics)\tpass\nhttps://10.4.4.10/servlet/EPServlet?opt=etradepda\t\t(pda)\t\tFail\tThe application is temporarily\nunavailable.

Paulo's request for screen shots and Siebel's unwillingness to have us in the meeting Friday smells funny at this stage.  We're obviously being set up for a push on S7.5 HH, with AvocadoIT as an  also mentioned   Fortunately, Symbol is in our camp and probably in a better customer position than Siebel with Dow.  Allen Rivet - the WW Dow AE for Symbol even mentioned that Dow is considering other application vendors for call center/dispatch.  Yes, Centricon is a Siebel 6 customer, but for Sales -- this attempted Siebel sale is for S7 Call Center and Dispatch/Field Service.\nEither way, I expressed my uneasiness to Al on a potential end-around from Siebel and he said he dances with who brought him and would act as our advocate, etc. in Fridays meeting and going forward.  He also said he asked Eric Downs directly what the issue was with having AvocadoIT represented at Fridays meeting and Eric said  just too early - but yes, this sounds like it definately requires AvocadoIT .  Problem here is our strategy of by-passing the Product Group and working directly with Siebel Field Sales gets muddled when Product Marketing (ie Paulo, Stone) gets involved.  This is not a lead from Siebel, this is a Siebel deal that we structured to leverage Symbol leasing and support to overcome Dow AgroSci recent purchase of 6000 Dolphin DOS devices.\nThat said, Siebel product group will be pushing Eric Down (Siebel DM) to sell HH.  The way we differentiate at this stage is:\n1) stay close to Symbol - all our screen shots, etc should be on an 8100\n2) show application that is idiot proof.  Allen claims that is Dow's #1 priority - making a windows based app that any pest-control guy can understand.  The Dannone app look and feel (using photos, etc) would set us apart.\nAllen has agreed to hold a call with us Friday afternoon with his takeaway from Friday's meeting.  Further, he is forwarding to me tonight Dow's  Prolinx  outline - which is an overview of their current methology/app/hardware for this field pest control guys.

In my view we could make Sales Training even more effective if we:\n*\tHave one owner\t- there were too many people making suggestions and requests with little co-ordination.\n*\tPlan ahead more - we should be setting dates for these events in advance (and stick to them, the last-minute changes this time were very costly in both time and money).\n*\tHave strict timing for individual sessions - presenters should rehearse their presentations in advance and allow sensible time for questions and discussion (less is more).\n*\tGive presenters some presentation/facilitator skills training - the purpose is to train people, impart knowledge and to do so we need more interaction, less info dump - some presenters need help with this.\n*\tFocused on sales skills sessions - take out presentations that could be delivered equally well by Webex.\nI believe that in the light of Jim's departure we should be planning some weekly sales update meetings (which we should start asap). These might take the form of a weekly Web Ex conference call. We could, for example devote the main part of each meeting to subjects like AC, CGE&Y, Pricing, Legal Contracts, Selected competitors etc etc.\nThis would enable us to get more information to the sales team more effectively and more timely. We could also then build on these sessions in the next quarterly sales training event by running exercises/role-plays based on these meetings. I would be happy to get these started in co-ordination with Gene and David or Mary.\nOnce a month we might want to invite a partner or a customer to talk, or an AE manager to explain some of the internal processes in more detail.\nPriorities\nOne of the items which Venk highlighted in his summary of the meeting on Monday was the need to train our sales force in how to manage our partners:\n Leveraging our Partnerships \t-\twe should be implementing a focused training program for Sales and Business development on how to get the most out of our partnerships. As you know, I have a solution in this area, (similar to the program which we delivered at Rhythms). I have talked about it in outline with David Chan and he is very receptive. He believes we should do this sooner rather than later.\nMy recommendation would be to run the program with Biz Dev first, then for the sales folks. The focus for the session would be get each Biz Dev Alliance Managers and Directors to produce a 'corporate Partnership Plan' for each major partner (concentrating on those partners with whom sales can engage effectively NOW). These plans would provide the basis for the sales people to adapt for their regions or focused lines of business. The Partnership Plans which they produce will then form the basis for their discussions with the partner's sales/consulting teams in their region.\nAt this point, it is likely that members of the Biz Dev team will need to get active in the field, providing direct support to the sales people.\nI will develop a proposal around these ideas for discussion next week and presentation to Venk.\nChris\n________________________\nChris Longstaffe\nDirector of Training, AvocadoIT\nTel: (408) 562 8132\nCell: (408) 205 7573", "output": "Lisa - Person Name, Jim' - Person Name, Gene - Person Name, David - Person Name, Mary - Person Name, Venk - Person Name, David Chan - Person Name, Venk - Person Name, Chris - Person Name, Chris Longstaffe - Person Name, Tel: (408) 562 8132\nCell: (408) 205 7573 - Phone Number"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "id HNAJQ6B3; Wed, 4 Apr 2001 08:10:57 -0700\nby mailer.avocadoit.com (8.10.2/8.10.2) with SMTP id f34F7nb29347\nfor <bsheth@avocadoit.com>; Wed, 4 Apr 2001 08:07:49 -0700\nX-eGroups-Return: sentto-2940004-157-986397132-bsheth=avocadoit.com@returns.onelist.com\nX-Sender: nipa_sheth@yahoo.com\nX-Apparently-To: zingaris@yahoogroups.com\nMailing-List: list zingaris@yahoogroups.com; contact zingaris-owner@yahoogroups.com\nDelivered-To: mailing list zingaris@yahoogroups.com\nPrecedence: bulk\nList-Unsubscribe: <mailto:zingaris-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com>\nthx priyank. btw, does this mean that you're not\ncoming?\n4 cars for 4 alternate plans....\n-N\n--- Priyank <priyankdesai@yahoo.com> wrote:\n> Hi!\n>\n> A friend of mine from USC stays somewhere in santa\n> monica..\n> I tried contacting him today but his number has\n> changed.\n> Have sent him an email.

And Java, released about the same time and promoted as the ultimate cross-platform programming language, was supposed to spell the end of Microsoft's Windows.\nIn new formations, Mr. Lazaridis said, they will unite all wireless devices, from RIM's BlackBerry to cellphones and connected personal digital assistants.\nMoreover, Mr. Lazaridis said, the much-touted third-generation (3G) of wireless devices is closer than we think. Technology called 2.5G already delivers everything we want \u2014 including e-mail, short messaging services, voice communication and location management \u2014 with the exception of full-motion video.\nThese services \u2014 e-mail, voice, SMS and paging \u2014 are already available, and most people just need to be made aware of their presence, he said.\n The key is people start using [the technology] and don't even notice it,  he said.  It's the ultimate passive experience. \nRIM is also betting that a new version of Java for mobile devices, called Java 2 micro edition (J2ME), will be what powers all wireless devices of the future, he said.\n We must move to one universal, powerful, open standard,  he said.\nHe added that the benefits of J2ME are the reduced cost of setting it up, the wide capabilities of the programming language, the ability to store data locally, its security features and its ability to be upgraded from a remote position.\n Java will be at the heart of e-commerce,  Mr. Lazaridis said.  It's absolutely necessary. \nspace\nInteractive\n\u2022 Stock Quote/Chart: Research In Motion, Toronto  Research In Motion, Nasdaq\nBack to technology home\nCyberia:\nThe hunt for B flat\nComdex:\nComdex Canada rides out tech turmoil\nCheck out the:\nPDA Playoffs!\n_____\nCopyright \u00a9 2001 Globe Interactive, a division of Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc.\nHelp & Contact Us | Back to the top of this page\nHome | Search | Tech Investor | Tech Talk | Tech Alert | Events", "output": "Wed, 11 Jul 2001 - Date, Wed, 11 Jul 2001 - Date, Wed, 11 Jul 2001 - Date, Richard Fogel\" <richard.fogel@avocadoit.com>, - Email, 'D'Arcy Salzmann'\" <Darcy.Salzmann@avocadoit.com> - Email, Karna Gupta\" <karna.gupta@avocadoit.com>, - Email, Rini Gahir\" <rini.gahir@sitraka.com>, - Email, Paul Gardner'\" <pgardner@mcleanwatson.com>, - Email, Ed Lycklama\" <ed@sitraka.com> - Email, Sitraka Mobility - Organizations, AvocadoIT Colossus - Organizations, Brad - Person Name, Wednesday, July 11 - Date, Toronto - Location, Nasdaq - Location, JACK KAPICA - Person Name, Toronto - Location, BlackBerry - Organizations, Mike Lazaridis - Person Name, Canada - Location, Toronto  - Location, Java - Brand Name, Microsoft's Windows - Brand Name, Mr. Lazaridis - Person Name, Mr. Lazaridis - Person Name, Mr. Lazaridis - Person Name"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "id R8DG9573; Fri, 1 Sep 2000 00:38:33 -0700\nby mail2.java.sun.com (8.10.0.Beta13+Sun/8.10.0.Beta13) with ESMTP id e817OkY05976;\nFri, 1 Sep 2000 00:24:46 -0700 (PDT)\nspool id 1986706 for JSP-INTEREST@JAVA.SUN.COM; Fri, 1 Sep 2000\n00:25:41 -0700\nmail.java.sun.com (8.10.0.Beta13+Sun/8.10.0.Beta13) with ESMTP id\ne817PdJ04644 for <JSP-INTEREST@JAVA.SUN.COM>; Fri, 1 Sep 2000\n00:25:40 -0700 (PDT)\ne817PeJ04648\nreference <JSP-INTEREST@java.sun.com>\nreference <JSP-INTEREST@java.sun.com>\nHow can i nstall these 3 dll or where do i have to place them?\n-----Message d'origine-----\nDe : Artem Babenko [mailto:artem@SENDMAIL.RU]\nEnvoy\u00e9 : jeudi 31 ao\u00fbt 2000 18:18\n\u00c0 : JSP-INTEREST@JAVA.SUN.COM\nObjet : Re: Jsp and asp on the IIS?\nHi\nOf corse you can\nI have downloaded this from apache.org\nisapi_redirect.dll   --- maybe this will help you to install tomcat at the\nIIS\njni_connect.dll\nnsapi_redirect.dll\ntomcat does not install into IIS.

Judging from the 3 month average usage on this cellular number (650)619-1467,  I believe the best retail rate plan would be our digital one rate plan ($59.99 a month).  This rate plan includes 450 minutes anytime (day/night), and minutes used after that would be 0.35 cents.   There has been an average talktime of 339 minutes, and an average usage costs of ($57.76 a month) on the old account.  Please let me know if this rate plan is agreed on.

One interesting snipet I did pick up was that Corsair has a billing platform plus certain ecare/customer care functionality - what are your thoughts on partnering with them? (my initial read is that their billing platform is nothing special - unlike the packet based billing model being developed by folks like Portal) What do you think?\nRon\nCorsair Communications, Inc. (Nasdaq: CAIR), a leading provider of real-time billing and mobile commerce systems for the global wireless industry, today announced its infrastructure- independent, real-time billing system, PrePay Open(tm), and the company's first mobile commerce (mCommerce) application, PhoneFuel(tm). Corsair believes PrePay Open offers wireless carriers the most cost-effective and scalable real-time billing system that supports a broad range of standard wireless infrastructures. PrePay Open also provides the functionality of the WIN II (Wireless Intelligent Network) standard today with an easy plug-and-play software migration to WIN II when the industry is ready. PhoneFuel allows carriers to offer WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) and WEB enabled phone replenishment and account management services to their subscribers. With PrePay Open and PhoneFuel, carriers will have a path to new technology and enhanced prepaid wireless offerings for their subscribers.\nEnabling Infrastructure for Post-PC Era\n************************************\nRon D Silverton\nDirector of Strategic Marketing\n3231 Scott Boulevard\nSanta Clara, CA  95054\nTel: (408) 562-8039\nMobile: (415) 845-6789\nFax: (408) 408.562.8100\nrsilverton@avocadoit.com\n************************************", "output": "Ray - Person Name, Corsair - Organizations, Ron - Person Name, Corsair Communications - Organizations, PrePay Open(tm) - Brand Name, PrePay Open  - Brand Name, PrePay Open - Brand Name, PhoneFuel, - Brand Name, Ron D Silverton - Person Name, 3231 Scott Boulevard\nSanta Clara, CA  95054 - Address, (408) 562-8039 - Phone Number, (415) 845-6789 - Phone Number, (408) 408.562.8100 - Phone Number, rsilverton@avocadoit.com - Email"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "id VSR26SW8; Sun, 29 Oct 2000 02:52:10 -0700\nReply-to:  nytdirect@nytimes.com\nTODAY'S HEADLINES\nThe New York Times on the Web\nSunday, October 29, 2000\n------------------------------------------------------------\nFor news updated throughout the day, visit www.nytimes.com\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n=========================\n I'm a fool.

ORANGE AIMS FOR SUMMER GPRS LAUNCH\nOrange has said that it is aiming to launch GPRS in the summer, as it enjoys\npositive momentum in all its main markets so far this year.\nOrange said subscriber numbers in the UK had risen to 10.6 million, compared\nwith 9.8 million at the end of 2000. Earlier the company said it had 30.5\nmillion controlled customers at the end of 2000, a rise of 68 percent.\nOrange reported a 2000 net loss of EUR1.321 billion, little changed against\na 1999 pro-forma of EUR1.322 billion and above the level some had forecast.\nOrange said the launch of GPRS services would be in the UK and France in\nJuly or August, with plans for a range of between 10 and 15 GPRS handsets by\nthe end of 2001.\nOrange has picked Motorola to provide the launch GPRS handsets. But Graham\nHowe, CFO, Orange, said momentum in GPRS roll-out would not really kick in\nuntil 2002.\nOrange reported EBITDA in 2000 of EUR1.765 billion, while the loss before\ntax, goodwill, amortisation and minority interests was EUR409 million, from\n1999's EUR630 million.

Edwards buy keeps customers in mind\nBy Erich Luening <mailto:erichl@cnet.com>\nStaff Writer, CNET News.com\nAugust 15, 2001, 1:45 p.m. PT\nJ.D. Edwards announced an acquisition Wednesday that would bulk up its software tools for companies wanting to build closer relationships with their customers.\nThe enterprise software maker said it agreed to buy Charlotte, N.C.-based Youcentric for $86 million. Youcentric makes collaborative customer relationship management (CRM) software, which allows companies to coordinate sales campaigns and automate their relationships with customers.\nDenver-based J.D. Edwards plans to buy privately held Youcentric <http://www.youcentric.com> in exchange for J.D. Edwards common stock and cash. The mix of common stock and cash will be determined upon closing, which is expected to be in 60 to 90 days, subject to regulatory approval.\nThe acquisition gives J.D. Edwards the ability to gain ground on its competitors in the enterprise resource planning software industry, including SAP, Oracle and PeopleSoft. All of these companies have been trying to find ways to knock </news/0-1007-200-4571987.html> Siebel Systems from its throne atop the market.\nBy adding Youcentric technology, J.D. Edwards hopes to deliver a set of combined collaborative applications that let companies electronically manage their business relationships.\nJ.D. Edwards, like its rivals, is looking to take a piece of the multi-billion dollar market for customer resource management software. Industry research firm IDC estimated this week that the market for the software soared 84 percent to $6.2 billion in 2000. By 2005, IDC is expecting companies in the industry to generate $14 billion in revenue.\nThe importance of customer relationship management software and its potential for growth is highlighted by J.D. Edwards' decision to buy Youcentric amid tough economic times, one analyst said.\n Despite the current economic downturn, end-user organizations continue to rate (the software) as critical to their organizations' ongoing business strategy,  Mary Wardley, an IDC analyst, said in a statement.", "output": "J.D.

In addition getting a NDA signed seems a bit extreme. If I was customer and I was qualified to sign an NDA before getting to understand the product I would think to myself,  Dude, these guys are paranoid.  Which in return will leave a bad first impression.\nAnother point to make is sometimes you never know who will show up for the dance. I've been in meeting were there is no technical guys that are scheduled, then all of a sudden they pour in during the meeting and I wind up doing a technical presentation. These have turned out to be the best situation because you get everyone there at once and when you see technical agreement after business talk, you are just about there to seal a scoping project.\nHere is my suggestions:\nI think they should have guidelines such as these, but I would leave it up to the Sales person to make a judgment call if they should or shouldn't bring a tech heavy in. Secondly I think they should be notified that sales engineers are to be used more thoughtfully then before. In addition, if the meeting is made within the vicinity of where the SE lives I don't see it as a bad thing to bring him in, unless they know for sure it is all business. Lastly the NDA seems a bit too much. I can't imagine breaking the flow of initial relationship with a NDA process thrown in.\nI still believe it is a great guideline for the sales person to use to determine if they need an SE. Also it may help them to get more details to qualify if the lead is real or not. Lastly it would be nice to know before I walk in what I'm dealing with, but it is not that big of a deal.\nJust some thoughts,", "output": "Dan - Person Name"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "Just spoke to Anne at HP.

But when I tried to access the same page with\nNetscape, it just stayed there and the status line displayed  ...waiting for\nreply... . Sometimes it made it with the first page after a VERY long time,\nbut the second page it definately won't display. No error, it just sit there\nwaiting! The other browsers can handle all the pages with ease.\nI don't think I have any specific configuration in Netscape which could lead\nto this, but you can never be sure!

These guys are analysts, not Sales folks - however, I think the point we haven't really talked about much is finding the common enemy - like a competitor.\nDo you have any suggestions on how to sell CRM inside the organization?\nA: Yes, but they're really more than suggestions. They are closer to be being business rules.\nRule One: There is no silver bullet.\nRule Two: Look for friends in odd places. CRM is a business strategy that often has multiple parts of the organization touching it. Consequently, all those parts must pull together to maximize the effectiveness of the CRM initiatives.\nRule Three: Build CRM justification to management brick by brick.\nRule Four: Look for the major  pain points.  Most enterprises already know the weak points of their CRM efforts. Selling the plan will be easier if the sales efforts are concentrated on the pain points.\nRule Five: Have management become a customer.\nRule Six: Think strategically, but invest tactically. Don't try to accomplish all of CRM in one initiative, but you must know where you're headed. That way you can invest for specific, near-term results and still work effectively toward the long-run strategy.\nRule Seven: Find an enemy. Enterprises always work better if they can band together around a common enemy. So look at what the competition is doing in the CRM arena and use that as justification for many of these initiatives.\nRule Eight: Involve your customers every step of the way.\nYour Business  Everywhere\n***********************************************\nRon Silverton\nDirector of Strategic Marketing\nAvocadoIT, Inc\n2211 N First Street, Suite 200\nSan Jose CA, 95131\nw 408.562-8039\nm 415.845-6789\nf 408.5622-8100\nwww.avocadoit.com\n*************************************************", "output": "Gartner - Organizations, Ron Silverton - Person Name, AvocadoIT, Inc\n2211 N First Street, Suite 200\nSan Jose CA, 95131 - Address, w 408.562-8039\nm 415.845-6789\nf 408.5622-8100 - Phone Number, www.avocadoit.com - URL"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "Return-Path: <Geoff.Vona@avocadoit.com>\nby sitraka.com (8.8.8/8.8.4) with ESMTP\nid JAA24369; Fri, 29 Jun 2001 09:21:30 -0400 (EDT)\nby po.klgroup.com (8.9.3/8.9.3) with ESMTP id JAA22010;\nFri, 29 Jun 2001 09:52:14 -0400\nid <K6V2XBZH>; Fri, 29 Jun 2001 06:21:55 -0700\ncharset= iso-8859-1 \nX-UIDL: @W0 !8a<!!_=X!!,7* !\nStatus: U\nI know of at least two people who didn't get\npaid last night.\nPlease double-check to make sure you got paid.\nIf you didn't, please send me an e-mail.\n(I have to track this down for two of my team\nmembers anyways, so I might as well do the entire\nlist.)\n---\nGeoff Vona\nAvocadoIT\nhttp://www.avocadoit.com", "output": "<Geoff.Vona@avocadoit.com> - Email, Fri, 29 Jun 2001 - Date, Fri, 29 Jun 2001 - Date, Fri, 29 Jun 2001 - Date, Geoff Vona - Person Name, http://www.avocadoit.com - URL"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "id FHNSTZ0D; Fri, 23 Feb 2001 17:21:42 -0800\nby mailer.avocadoit.com (8.10.2/8.10.2) with SMTP id f1O179D09250\nfor <dbaca@avocadoit.com>; Fri, 23 Feb 2001 17:07:09 -0800\nby ntr.net (8.9.3/8.9.3) with SMTP id UAA21522\nfor <dbaca@avocadoit.com>; Fri, 23 Feb 2001 20:23:38 -0500\nboundary= ----=_NextPart_000_0000_01C09DBC.AE4ABD00 \nX-MSMail-Priority: Normal\nX-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V5.00.2919.6700\nThis is a multi-part message in MIME format.\n------=_NextPart_000_0000_01C09DBC.AE4ABD00\nboundary= ----=_NextPart_001_0001_01C09DBC.AE50D780 \n------=_NextPart_001_0001_01C09DBC.AE50D780\ncharset= iso-8859-1 \n------=_NextPart_001_0001_01C09DBC.AE50D780\ncharset= iso-8859-1 \n------=_NextPart_001_0001_01C09DBC.AE50D780--\n------=_NextPart_000_0000_01C09DBC.AE4ABD00\nname= tqlogo.gif \nContent-ID: <741261601@24022001-168d>\n------=_NextPart_000_0000_01C09DBC.AE4ABD00--\nHi Dan,\nBradley never heard from Ricardo Garcia, so if you can please follow up with him, that would be great.

The two-day event will feature over 40 speakers from both\npublic and private global wireless services and infrastructure companies, including carriers,\nequipment vendors, wireless application service providers, and voice-enabled service\nproviders.\nHosted by Lehman Brothers' senior wireless analysts John Bensche (Services) and Tim\nLuke (Infrastructure), the event will also feature two panel discussions:  Bluetooth and\nOther Next Generation Solutions: Complementary or Competitive?  and  Still Voice After\nAll These Years. \n The enthusiasm for next generation wireless technology has cooled somewhat since last\nyear,  remarked Messrs. Bensche and Luke.  Through this conference, we intend to explore\nwhen a turn in the market could be expected, the timing for the rollout of next generation\nservices, which business models and applications have sustainable value and the general\nquestion: Which way do we go now? \nInvited companies to the conference include: 724; Aether Systems; AT&T Wireless; Cisco\nSystems; Comverse; Emblaze; Ericsson; Giant Bear; GoAmerica; mDiversity; Mobileum;\nMotient; Nokia; OmniSky; Openwave; QUALCOMM; Research in Motion; Sierra\nWireless; SignalSoft; Sprint PCS; Talk2 Technologies; and True Position.*\nLehman Brothers' Global Equity Research Group comprises some 600 professionals in New\nYork, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Menlo Park, Washington, D.C., London, Hong\nKong, Tokyo, and Sao Paulo following more than 1,600 companies in 75 industries\nworldwide.\nLehman Brothers (ticker: LEH), an innovator in global finance, focuses on serving the\nfinancial needs of corporations, governments and municipalities, institutional clients, and\nhigh-net-worth individuals worldwide.

Forrester is not as bullish as others and the reports primary intended audience is carriers.\n*\tIt notes that the carriers are bullish but that Forrester thinks the market will not be as big as the carriers expect and that carriers will not succeed at being more than a pipe, so stop trying.\n*\tMobile data revenue - up to $3.8B in 2005 - is the share they think carriers will capture - not mobile commerce.\n*\tMobile advertising is not given much credence due to privacy concerns.  Content will remain king, so Yahoo! and Amazon will be strong in the wireless world as well.\n*\tIt does note that the carriers should support innovative new wireless apps and open their platforms - both good for us (they mention Yodlee as an example).\n*\tIn terms of usage, US mobile Net subs is projected to increase to 111 million in the US by 2005, but remain tiny through 2001\n*\tForrester believes the mobile net should be important to  carriers because of its indirect benefits: not the direct rev from mobile data or commerce, but the impact on ARPU and churn and the increase in voice rev.  Sadly, they make no mention of mixed media or multimodality, which I believe will drive both higher - (but this gives me something to discuss with the analyst during my conference call with her tomorrow.)\n*\tFocus on eCare - an area we can really help the carriers and anyone else who wants to host a portal or be a wireless ISP\n*\tBig believers in extended value chains and mobilizing front and back end enterprise apps such as i2 and CommerceOne\n*\tVOICE PORTAL will be big - they even think some of the smaller operators may acquire folks like TellMe to drive usage.

However, he misses a few crucial elements. Nothing is preventing him from building out his next great idea by himself. If he really believes in his own brilliance, there's nothing stopping him from striking out on his own, using his own money to fund his venture. Also, I think Richard undervalues the importance of the team in developing an idea. For all his deriding of others, Richard couldn't market his way out of a paper bag, he can't lead a development team, and he couldn't sell to a business customer if he tried. Like the rest of us, he's an important cog in making the whole venture successful, but he's not able to create success without others. The difference between Sitraka and AvocadoIT is that Richard had seniority at Sitraka and he had Dewaine to pump his ego. With Dewaine gone, and his new manager far more deliverable-driven, Richard will need to evolve his attitudes and perceptions to the expectations of the new organization. If he doesn't, he risks alienating himself or, worse, setting himself up for failure.\nI think Geoff is the most connected of us all.

Gartner Dataquest, a research company, said growth will be stagnant following a 37 percent increase last year.\n``The year started with all companies being optimistic about handset sales, but slowly people became more negative,'' said Theo Kitz, an analyst at Merck, Finck & Company in Munich. ``Consumers are really not buying new handsets.''\nNokia Oyj, the largest mobile phone maker, and Ericsson AB, the biggest maker of cellular phone networks, posted record profits last year as wireless services expanded worldwide. Analysts this week expect second-quarter earnings to fall 27 percent at Nokia and to a loss at Ericsson as consumers delay purchases and telephone companies struggle to pay off debt.\nNokia's shares yesterday fell 53 cents, or 2.6 percent, to 20.15 euros. Ericsson's fell 1.5 krona, or 2.9 percent, to 50.5 kronor. Both stocks have lost more than half their value this year, mirroring a 61 percent drop in Bloomberg's index of European telecommunications equipment makers.\nMotorola Inc. inventor Dr. Martin Cooper patented a ``radio telephone system'' in 1975, two years before the company's phones were used for the first test calls in the Washington and Baltimore area, according to Motorola.\nOptimistic Forecasts\nThe picture was rosier six months ago. In January, Morgan Stanley expected shipments of 509 million. Ericsson, the No. 4 phonemaker, was predicting as many as 525 million units. Nokia was hoping for as many 550 million.\nSince then, Nokia has revised its forecast three times. It now expects ``very modest growth'' compare with last year's 405 million. Siemens AG, Europe's No. 2 maker of handsets, in May predicted worldwide handset sales of about 400 million this year.\nNokia and Ericsson are expected to update their forecasts when they report earnings this week. Siemens will likely give a new prediction when it posts third-quarter figures July 25.\n``Over the last four to six years, there's been an average of 45 percent to 65 percent annual sales growth, so we're bound to see a slowdown in the rate of growth,'' said Bryan Prohm, senior analyst at Gartner Dataquest. ``What's taken everyone by surprise is that the growth rate this year may approach zero.''\nAnd many of those sales will come from existing inventory, Prohm said. Actual new production of mobile phones probably will fall 16 percent this year to about 370 million units from about 440 million in 2000.\nProfit Declines\nNokia, which reports second-quarter earnings on Thursday, expects per-share earnings of 15 euro cents to 17 cents in the second quarter, down from an earlier prediction of 20 cents. Sales will grow less than 10 percent, compared with a previous forecast of 20 percent.\nEricsson, which reports earnings for the same period on Friday, said in April it may lose more money in the second quarter than in the first. The Swedish company forecast a pretax loss of at least 4.9 billion kronor ($454 million) in the period, excluding a 15 billion kronor charge.\nMobile phone equipment makers are also feeling the pinch as phone companies reduce spending on cellular networks. Those customers spent about $100 billion last year on licenses for Universal Mobile Telecommunication Services, or UMTS, which allows faster Internet access on mobile phones. Now they're looking to pare debt.\nAbout a quarter of Nokia's sales come from equipment for wireless networks. At Ericsson, such products made up about 60 percent of sales in the first quarter.\nStopping Subsidies\nPhone companies such as Vodafone Group Plc plan to increase revenue from each subscriber by ending the practice of subsidizing the cost of mobile phones when consumers buy a subscription. That will prompt some people to keep their old models instead, analyst said.\nThe next ray of hope is phones based on General Packet Radio Service, or GPRS, the next step from the current standard that offers some of the same benefits as UMTS.\nGPRS phones, which have already started shipping, may help spur sales next year, although only to single-digit growth rates, analyst Kitz said. Analysts at HSBC expect GPRS to drive growth to 14 percent in 2002, while Morgan Stanley analysts predict a rebound of 18 percent next year to 440 million mobile phones.\n``You can't realistically expect the adoption en mass that a lot of financial analysts predicted and carriers are hoping for,'' said Gartner's Prohm. ``It will take months if not years of teaching users the value of the services.''\n\u00a92001 Bloomberg L.P.

You store your JSP pages in a structure like this:\nmyapp/foo.jsp\nmyapp/bar.jsp\nmyapp/other/fee.jsp\nmyapp/other/baz.jsp\nIf you want requests for the JSP pages in the /other directory to be processed\nfirst by a servlet and then by the standard JSP container, you can do this.\nFirst define a URI mapping for the servlet in WEB-INF/web.xml:\n<web-app>\n<servlet>\n<servlet-name>controller</servlet-name>\n<servlet-class>ControllerServlet</servlet-class>\n</servlet>\n...\n<servlet-mapping>\n<servlet-name>controller</servlet-name>\n<url-pattern>/controller/*</url-pattern>\n</servlet-mapping>\n...\n</web-app>\nThen you request the JSP pages with URIs like:\n/myapp/controller/other/fee.jsp\nThis URI maps to the controller servlet, so it will be invoked. It can get\nthe context-relative URI for the JSP page like this:\nString uri = request.getPathInfo();\nWhen it's ready to let the JSP container process the JSP page, it gets\na RequestDispatcher and includes or forwards to the JSP page:\nRequestDispatcher rd = getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher(uri);\nrd.include(request, response);\nNote that nothing prevents a user from requesting the JSP page directly,\nwith a URI like /other/fee.jsp. Depending on which container you use,\nyou may be able to use security constraints to restrict access to URIs\nlike this though.\nHans\n--\nHans Bergsten           hans@gefionsoftware.com\nGefion Software         http://www.gefionsoftware.com\nTo unsubscribe: mailto listserv@java.sun.com with body:  signoff JSP-INTEREST .\nSome relevant FAQs on JSP/Servlets can be found at:\nhttp://java.sun.com/products/jsp/faq.html\nhttp://www.esperanto.org.nz/jsp/jspfaq.html\nhttp://www.jguru.com/jguru/faq/faqpage.jsp?name=JSP\nhttp://www.jguru.com/jguru/faq/faqpage.jsp?name=Servlets", "output": "Wed, 12 Jul 2000 - Date, Wed, 12 Jul 2000 - Date, JSP-INTEREST@JAVA.SUN.COM - Email, Wed, 12 Jul 2000 - Date, <JSP-INTEREST@JAVA.SUN.COM> - Email, Wed, 12 Jul 2000 - Date, <JSP-INTEREST@JAVA.SUN.COM> - Email, Wed, 12 Jul 2000  - Date, <72A838A51366D211B3B30008C7F4D36303EB6FE9@pchnc.hnc.com> - Email, <JSP-INTEREST@java.sun.com> - Email, <JSP-INTEREST@java.sun.com> - Email, Gefion software - Organizations, Williams, Stephen - Person Name, Jim Preston - Person Name, Jason's - Person Name, Hans - Person Name, Hans Bergsten - Person Name, hans@gefionsoftware.com - Email, http://www.gefionsoftware.com - URL, listserv@java.sun.com - URL, http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/faq.html\nhttp://www.esperanto.org.nz/jsp/jspfaq.html\nhttp://www.jguru.com/jguru/faq/faqpage.jsp?name=JSP\nhttp://www.jguru.com/jguru/faq/faqpage.jsp?name=Servlets - URL"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "id Y22LTFJJ; Fri, 22 Dec 2000 11:28:40 -0800\nby mailer.avocadoit.com (8.10.2/8.10.2) with SMTP id eBMJ8VD10211\nfor <dbaca@avocadoit.com>; Fri, 22 Dec 2000 11:08:31 -0800\n(InterMail vM.5.01.01.01 201-252-104) with SMTP\nid <20001222191428.PQHN24760.oe-mp2.bizmailsrvcs.net@ksimpson>\nfor <dbaca@avocadoit.com>; Fri, 22 Dec 2000 13:14:28 -0600\ncharset= iso-8859-1 \nX-MSMail-Priority: Normal\nX-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V5.50.4133.2400\nHey Dan!\nMerged company is very good.

They are starting to explore options/launch pilots incorporating access to intra/extranets through inexpensive/disposable wireless devices (eg $400 Palm VII vs $3000 TRG operating on PalmOS) but we need to move quickly or others will fill this space.\nRon\nAvantGo Offers British Gas Execs Mobile Intra/Internet\nSAN MATEO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 5, 2000--Top executives at BG Group plc, formerly British Gas plc, are benefiting from handheld access to their corporate intranet using technology from AvantGo, Inc., the authority in managing mobile information.\nAvantGo Enterprise(TM) delivers essential business data to the Palm Computing devices of more than 250 members of the BG `Leadership Group' around the world. Drawing information from BG's award winning intranet, Kite, the new system enables mobile BG executives to instantly access up-to-date briefing documents, positioning papers, skills databases and contacts directories.\nTom O'Connor, head of knowledge management systems at BG Group plc, said:  With AvantGo, our employees have access to the information that's vital to our business wherever they may be in the world. Executives can respond to any situation on the fly because they can instantly tap into facts and figures, corporate messages and data about all our projects around the world. The AvantGo solution also enables them to identify, anywhere and at any time, the appropriate experts within BG who they can contact for further assistance. \nPhil Hibberd, vice president of AvantGo Europe, said:  What really sets this implementation apart is that BG are rolling out AvantGo technology to their top level decision makers from the word go. It shows that a state of the art mobile product that's user friendly and intuitive can provide real business benefits to employees across the whole company not just sales or field-based staff.  AvantGo Enterprise offers users of both Palm OS and Windows CE devices instant access to networked applications and Web content, either in real-time using a wireless connection, or via their normal synchronisation process with a desktop PC. Comprising server, client and connector applications, the mobile solution automatically consolidates, compresses and transfers essential information for handheld access.\nSupport for WAP-enabled mobile phones has recently been added to AvantGo software. Through partnerships with OpenSky, Novatel Wireless, AT&T Wireless and the WAP Forum, the new initiative enables the delivery of Web information to any wireless device.\nCentral administration and security are key features of AvantGo Enterprise. Using any Web browser and proper authentication, system administrators can roll out new applications and data to mobile users and groups of users. Featuring 128-bit and 56-bit SSL encryption, the updated server software delivers end-to-end security with the ability for administrators to store and transmit passwords securely.\nAccording to Tom O'Connor, AvantGo software now allows BG executives to use their handheld devices on three levels. In addition to the intranet functionality provided by AvantGo Enterprise and standard personal organiser features (diary, address book etc), they can also access valuable internet content through AvantGo's free personalised internet service, AvantGo Mobile Internet.\nAvailable as a free download, AvantGo Mobile Internet allows mobile device users to select personalised content from leading Web sites. The service's intelligent tracking and compression technology enables access to a vast amount of content. Over 350 optimised news, sports, financial, weather and entertainment channels are available including FT.com, The Economist, lastminute.com, ITN Online, StockSmart and Excite.\nBG is now considering extending AvantGo technology to other groups within the company -- the latest graduate intake has been issued Palm devices supporting AvantGo to familiarise themselves with handheld working. Tom O'Connor said:  The beauty of AvantGo's software is its multi-platform support. If in the future we decide to roll out Windows CE devices, or even WAP phones, our AvantGo system will work just as effectively without further investment. \nAbout BG\nBG Group has just under 20,000 employees worldwide. Its principal businesses are Transco, Great Britain's primary gas transporter, which operates a network of about 275,000 kilometres of pipes serving more than 20 million gas users; BG International, whose business is gas and oil exploration and production, and the development and supply of international gas markets.

The nice thing is now I'm living in Palo Alto, my law school roommate moved here from NY and he lives in the city, so I have full access to a wing-man and a place to sleep in SF (great place, but too damned expensive and difficult to get around, so I don't know if it's the long-term solution.\nWorkwise, I joined a white-hot wireless software company down in San Jose about 6 mos. ago as their in-house lawyer (left the cush big Wall Street firm on Sand Hill for the chance to cash in).  I did that just about the time the market hit the shitter, but our (mostly SouthAsian Indian) company is on fire.  We closed our C round of funding early at the end of  last year, have plenty of cash, and are the darlings of Wall Street (Goldman Sachs is taking us public if the market ever corrects;  if not, we'll probably get bought sometime soon).  I left the law about a month ago and hit the street selling the shit.  It's expensive, our customers are Fortune 1000s, and the commissions justify the switch.  I love it, although it's relatively new (of course I love it, right, it's like chasing women--work, for example,involves attending cruise dinners in San Diego like the one I  have to attend  Thursday.  Our company is called AvocadoIT, check the site ( www.avocadoit.com).\nThe personal front is the same.  Livin and flyin solo;  and in the Bay Area, bein 33 and single (and for once in good shape) lends itself to some  alternative connotations. \nHow's the pursuit of news media stardom?  Is it what you hoped for?  Your kids sound like a real  blessing, congratulations!

The Crossgain story could make for a decent movie.\nFrom the Barksdale (yes, the James Barksdale who testified against Microsoft) Group Web site:\nCrossgain enables companies to derive increased business value by providing a software services framework that makes it easy to build and automate business processes, without having to worry about the infrastructure complexities required to build today's web applications. The software service, using XML technology as a foundation, promises the ability to quickly build and deploy inter and intra-company business logic.\nWhy did The Barksdale Group select Crossgain?\nWe place an enormous premium on the quality, vision and commitment of management and technical teams. Crossgain's team has demonstrated great foresight with their early pioneering work on XML technologies and are committed to providing open software solutions. We are delighted to be part of growing a company that we believe will pioneer the software services business.\nFrom an article on the Web:\nThe 40-employee company, led by ex-Microsoft executives (now it gets even more interesting) Tod Nielsen and Adam Bosworth, is developing XML-based software services it says will  make it easy to build and automate business processes, without having to worry about the infrastructure complexities required to build today's Web applications. \nHere\u2019s an interesting article, too. http://www.xmlmag.com/upload/free/features/xml/2001/01jan01/sj0101xml/sj_side2.asp\nAnd Microsoft was not very happy about the way the start-up company pilfered its employees . . . http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2674574,00.html\nIn fact, according to this BusinessWeek piece, the dispute got very ugly:\nhttp://www.businessweek.com/2001/01_06/b3718159.htm\nGood article here, too, originally from the Wall Street Journal (May 31):\nhttp://www.msnbc.com/news/580644.asp\nIt appears CrossGain was building a Web services platform; that could still be what BEA wants it to do.\nMicrosoft basically drove these guys out of business.

That means every time the user makes a request\nusing a web browser, a new TCP connection is created and then dropped.\nServlet containers offer session management like most application servers,\nbut in fact is a very thin layer over the bare hhtp protocol. Usually they\ngive a cookie to the client browser and use it to track its further\nrequests.\nObviously this method never can be called robust. The cookie is  owned  by\nthe client, and you can't change it if the user does not make a new request.\nYou also should mantain a time table to expire the cookies and avoid\n ethernal  sessions. All these tasks are handled by your servlet container,\nand they will not work without careful set-up in server load-balancing\nenvironments.\nThe simplest and safest way to avoid this problems: drop the cookie crap and\nthe standard session handling. Start using keys in the URLs and keep the\nsession context in your database. A well designed session manager will be\nable to handle properly the context data for your application and also make\nit more portable.

Chapter 9 discusses the\ndirectory layout of a WAR file.  It should also be described in any reasonable\narticle or book that covers the 2.2 spec.\nA WAR file is in fact a JAR file with a different extension and with the described\ninternal data structure.  Therefore, you can create it with the standard JAR\ncommand line utilities.  Tomcat (<http://jakarta.apache.org>) includes an\nApplciation Developer's Guide that discusses the recommended organization for web\napplication projects, and uses the Ant build tool to automatically organize web\napplication structures for you.\nAll servlet containers that support the 2.2 version of the servlet spec are\nrequired to provide a way to deploy a WAR file into their environment.  For\nexample, in Tomcat you simply place your WAR file in the  webapps  directory and\nrestart, and the WAR file will automatically get expanded.  Each server may also\nprovide different ways to accomplish this as well (again for Tomcat, you can simply\nput a directory under  webapps  with the right files and directories inside, and it\nwill be recognized as a web application as well.\n>\n> Any links on this topic will be helpful.\n>\n> Thanks in advance\n> Varad\n>\nCraig McClanahan\nTo unsubscribe: mailto listserv@java.sun.com with body:  signoff JSP-INTEREST .\nSome relevant FAQs on JSP/Servlets can be found at:\nhttp://java.sun.com/products/jsp/faq.html\nhttp://www.esperanto.org.nz/jsp/jspfaq.html\nhttp://www.jguru.com/jguru/faq/faqpage.jsp?name=JSP\nhttp://www.jguru.com/jguru/faq/faqpage.jsp?name=Servlets", "output": "Sat, 5 Aug 2000 - Date, Sat, 5 Aug 2000  - Date, JSP-INTEREST@JAVA.SUN.COM - Email, Sat, 5 Aug 2000 - Date, <JSP-INTEREST@java.sun.com> - Email, Sat, 5 Aug 2000 - Date, <JSP-INTEREST@java.sun.com> - Email, Sat, 5 Aug 2000 - Date, <JSP-INTEREST@java.sun.com> - Email, Sat, 5 Aug 2000 - Date, <JSP-INTEREST@java.sun.com> - Email, Sat, 5 Aug 2000 - Date, 5 Aug 2000 - Date, <JSP-INTEREST@java.sun.com> - Email, <JSP-INTEREST@java.sun.com> - Email, <JSP-INTEREST@www.javasoft.com> - Email, <http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/download.html> - URL, Varad - Person Name, Craig McClanahan - Person Name, listserv@java.sun.com - Email, http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/faq.html\nhttp://www.esperanto.org.nz/jsp/jspfaq.html\nhttp://www.jguru.com/jguru/faq/faqpage.jsp?name=JSP\nhttp://www.jguru.com/jguru/faq/faqpage.jsp?name=Servlets - URL"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "id K6V2VYFM;

The consensus from First Call was loss in the current quarter of six cents per share; Nortel now says the expected loss will be about 48 cents per share. To make matters worse, Nortel is laying off another 10,000 employees, not including the 20,000 they've already slashed from the payroll, and the company is suspending its dividend distribution. It's not expecting a revenue upturn until the second half of 2002.\nBrad\n_____\nCNET Tech Sites: Price Comparisons | Product Reviews | Business Solutions | Downloads\nFront Page Enterprise E-Business Communications Media Personal Technology Investor\nNortel see large loss, additional layoffs\nBy Larry Dignan\nSpecial to CNET News.com\nJune 15, 2001, 4:20 a.m. PT\njust in Nortel Networks said Friday it will report a much larger-than-expected loss in the second quarter and lay off an additional 10,000 workers.\nThe telecommunications equipment maker said it will report a loss from operations of 48 cents a share on sales of about $4.5 billion. According to First Call, Nortel was expected to report a loss of 6 cents a share on revenue of $6.22 billion.\nIn addition, the company said it would suspend its dividend distribution. Discontinuing dividends is often seen by Wall Street as a sign of severe financial strain.\nFriday's layoffs are in addition to the 20,000 job cuts announced in April.\nNortel said it will meet its goal of cutting 20,000 jobs in the second quarter and close facilities. The Brampton, Ontario-based company said it will save $875 million from those moves and realize the savings in the third quarter.\nNortel also said it doesn't expect to see revenue growth until the second half of 2002.

We can create the press releases announcing this venture as part of the definitive agreement, but we would also like to include your association as part of our web site, collateral and presentation material (e.g. alliance partners).  Perhaps you could suggest language that would carve out that right, or conversely, we could stipulate that something to the effect that  any and all references to Motorola's products shall be truthful and not misleading  ( a SUN provision, which has granted us the right to use their logo's and trade marks).\nPlease call me on my mobile to discuss if you have any questions (510-409-7173).\nLet me know how we can help with the next steps to get to a definitive agreement.\nAll the best,\nCraig Stewart\nVP - Global Telecom Business Unit\nAvocadoIT\n3231 Scott Boulevard\nSanta Clara CA 95054\n408-562-8060 office\n408-562-8100 fax\n510-409-7173 mobile\nwww.avocadoit.com\n______________________________________________________________________\nGet Visto.com!

(VENTUREWIRE) -- CarParts Technologies, a provider of supply-chain management software to the automotive aftermarket, said it laid off more than 100 employees as part of a shift away from serving as an online retailer of automotive parts. The company also announced a licensing agreement with J.C. Whitney, a Chicago-based direct marketer of automotive parts.\nAs a result of the deal, J.C. Whitney will license the carparts.com URL and provide all sales and fulfillment services for the site. Financial terms of the licensing deal were not disclosed, but no equity was exchanged between the two companies.\nCarParts Technologies said it curtailed its online retail unit\nbecause it did not want to compete against the corporate clients of its supply-chain division. Though the company will continue to develop customer-fulfillment technology, CarParts said it is focusing on the supply-chain division for the commercial marketplace. As a result of the licensing agreement, CarParts said its consumer division was now profitable and that the company as a whole was expected to reach profitability by the second quarter of 2002.\nIn May, CarParts Technologies cut 23 employees from the CarParts.com division as it concentrated on its business-to-business division. At that time, CarParts Technologies employed 262 people; it now employs approximately 140 people.\nJ.C. Whitney is self-funded. CarParts Technologies has raised $68 million in three rounds from Barnard & Co., Brand Equity Ventures, CMGI @Ventures, Investor AB Group, Ravenswood Capital, Rho Management, and St. Paul Venture Capital.\nhttp://www.carparts.com\nhttp://www.carpartstechnologies.com\nSiemens is Latest Corporate VC to Consider Changes\t mail   top\nMUNICH, Germany (VENTUREWIRE) -- After reporting of a net loss, not including special items, of EUR489 million ($430.6 million) for the quarter ended June 30, Siemens is considering consolidating its venture capital operations into one business unit, VentureWire has learned. A source close to the firm confirmed that Siemens is reviewing its venture operations and expects to make a final decision by no later than October 1, 2001.\nSiemens venture capital activities fall under the umbrella of Siemens Venture Capital, which is based in Munich and provides the center of Siemens corporate venture capital operations, working with the differing venture divisions of its various business units. These business divisions include Siemens Mustang Ventures which invests for Siemens Information and Communication Networks, Automation & Drives, Medical Engineering, and Siemens Business Services.\nMustang received an initial commitment of $370 million for investment in the U.S., Europe, and Israel in 1998. The unit, based in Santa Clara, Calif., works specifically with Siemens' Information and Communication Networks, investing in networking and network-management technology. Mustang Ventures portfolio includes Sycamore Networks, Network Photonics, Accelerated Networks, PacketWave, and Virata.\nSiemens Venture Capital, which handles investments for a majority of the other business units, began investing in 1999 with EUR 200 million, to be committed over a three-year period. Prior to the launch of its dedicated business unit, Siemens had been active in venture capital as a limited partner in a number of funds for the past 15 years.\nAt present Siemens is a limited partner in funds including the California-based Band of Angels; Draper Atlantic of Reston, Va.; Lightspeed Venture Partners of Menlo Park, Calif.; Orama Partners of Israel; two German funds, Germany Polytechnos Venture Partners and STAR Ventures; and the investment arm of Vivendi Universal, Viventures based in Paris.\nSiemens Venture Capital is a separate legal entity from Siemens, but does respond to investment queries from Siemens' business units. The fund is able to make direct investments up to approximately EUR 3 million, but any investment above that requires the approval of an investment board consisting of Siemens executives. Siemens Venture Capital employs 13, including seven investment professionals.\nIndependently of Mustang Ventures, Siemens Venture Capital has had one exit, with November, a company which listed on the Neuer Markt in April, 2000. November's stock, which initially listed at EUR 40 per share, is now trading at about EUR 7.15 ($6.25) per share. In June, Siemens Venture Capital invested in Open Mind Technologies of Unterfoehring, Germany, a CAD/CAM software designer.\nSiemens isn't alone among corporations reassessing their venture capital operations. Compaq Computer placed investment activities in the hands of its respective business units, while Dell Ventures has cut its investment staff. Earlier this week, VentureWire reported that Lucent's New Ventures Group is considering stopping its investments or spinning out.\nAccording to spokespeople with both Siemens Venture Capital and Mustang Ventures, deal flow has been unaffected by the turmoil in the tech sector.  We are not very much affected by the public market,  one spokesperson said.  Now is actually the time to invest. The prices are very good. \nhttp://www.siemens.com\nPharmeceutical Firm Cell Genesys to Acquire Calydon for $20M\t mail   top\nFOSTER CITY, Calif. (VENTUREWIRE) -- Publicly traded pharmaceutical firm Cell Genesys announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Calydon, a developer of viral-based drug therapies for cancer in a deal worth about $20 million.\nUnder the terms of the all-stock transaction, Calydon shareholders and management will receive approximately 935,000 shares of Cell Genesys stock, valued at approximately $17.4 million. Cell Genesys will also assume Calydon's liabilities of approximately $2.6 million.\nCell Genesys said it plans to close Calydon's facilities by early 2002, but expects to retain the majority of Calydon's approximately 20 employees. Dan Henderson, president and CEO of Calydon, will serve as a consultant to Cell Genesys during the transition period.\nCell Genesys is focused on the development and commercialization of cancer vaccines and gene therapies to treat life-threatening diseases such as prostate cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, myeloma, and acute leukemia. Preclinical-stage programs include gene therapies for cancer, hemophilia, and cardiovascular disorders.\nThe acquisition of Calydon, which has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies, will expand Cell Genesys' cancer product platform with a complementary group of cancer treatments including CV706, Calydon's lead product candidate for early-stage prostate cancer, as well as other related products based on genetically engineered oncolytic viruses.\nFounded in 1994, Calydon has raised $25.4 million in four rounds of funding. The company was backed by Barr Rosenberg, Whitney & Co., Perseus Capital, and Sequoia Capital.\nhttp://www.calydon.com\nhttp://www.cellgenesys.com\nMetaMarkets.com Cuts 20%, Liquidates Investment Funds\t mail   top\nSAN FRANCISCO (VENTUREWIRE) -- MetaMarkets.com, which operates an Internet-based investment firm and financial commentary site, said it has reduced its staff by six employees, about 20%, and that its growth funds will be liquidated and their assets returned to shareholders. In addition, the company said it is seeking an acquirer.\nThe reduction in staff brings headcount to 24 employees. Layoffs occurred in the company's investment group, a company spokesperson said, and were on account of the liquidation of funds. No further reductions in staff are anticipated.\nThe liquidated funds were the OpenFund and the IPO & New Era Fund. According to the spokesperson, MetaMarkets.com will continue to provide original content, including market commentary from portfolio managers and traders.\nHe also said that MetaMarkets.com has entered into discussions with a number of potential buyers in the online financial services and financial content sectors, and is looking to be acquired before year's end. The company has retained the services of investment bank Allen & Company.\nMetaMarkets.com's backers include Europ@web, TD iCapital, Weeden & Company, as well as individuals including Charles Crocker, chairman, president, and CEO of BEI Technologies; Nicholas Negroponte, founder of MIT's Media Lab; Sanford Robertson, founder of Robertson Stephens; Scott Ryles, CEO of Epoch Partners; and Peter Sprague, chairman of Wave Systems.\nMetaMarkets.com was founded in May 1998.

(VENTUREWIRE) -- Versura, an online platform for higher education institutions, lenders, and loan buyers, announced it has raised $5 million in its first round of funding from Palisade Private Partnership, General Electric Trust, and a number of individual investors. The company said it will use the funding to expand its business through marketing and sales and investing in its Web site.\nVersura, which launched in September of 2000, previously raised funding from individuals. Palisade led this financing round. Jeff Salinger, the company's president and chief operating officer, said Versura has no plans to raise additional financing. He said the company expects to be profitable sometime next year. At least two investors are expected to join the company's board as a result of this round, Mr. Salinger said.\nVersura was co-founded by CEO Lydia Micheaux Marshall, Mr. Salinger, and five others. The company has a total of 19 employees.\nhttp://www.versura.com\nTransportation Software Firm Iteris Gets $9.7M First Round \tmail   top\nANAHEIM, Calif. (VENTUREWIRE) -- Odetics, a publicly traded company that develops technology companies in the transportation, telecom, and television industries to spin off to its shareholders, said its subsidiary, Iteris, which develops software for improving surface transportation, has raised $9.7 million in a first round of equity and convertible debt financing from DaimlerChrysler Venture and GIC Special Investments, the direct equity investment arm of the Government of Singapore Investment Corp. The financing is to be used as working capital.\nOdetics said Iteris now had a post-money valuation of a little over $50 million, with outside investors holding a little over 20% of Iteris. The financing was split between $5.5 million in equity and $4.2 million in convertible debt. Odetics also said one undisclosed representative for the new investors will join Iteris' board, which now has seven members. L.H.

(VENTUREWIRE) -- SimonDelivers.com, an online grocer that serves the Minneapolis and St. Paul metropolitan region, announced it has secured over $10 million of the $15 million it plans to raise in its Series D round of funding. The funding raised so far has come from Allen & Co., Blue Chip Venture, Dain Rauscher Wessels, Grotech Capital Group, Highfields Capital, The Walnut Group, and Winton Partners. The company plans to use the new financing to expand its services.\nAll the investors in the round so far have previously funded the company. Simon Foster, chairman and CEO, said the company expects to receive a significant investment from a new investor before the round is closed at $15 million. The Series D round is expected to take the company to profitability within 12 months, Mr. Foster said, adding that it is a flat round with a pre-money valuation of $65 million. Mr. Foster said that had the company not raised this round, it would have been forced to restructure.\nSimonDelivers.com is expecting $50 million in revenues this year, up from $11 million the previous year, said Mr. Foster. For now, he does not plan to expand nationally.\nHe said that the company has learned a lot from failed online grocers, which in recent weeks have included Webvan and HomeRuns.com, and is focused on reaching profitability.\nSimonDelivers' services now reaches 75% of the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan region. The company has raised $60 million in funding to date and employs 500 people.\nhttp://www.simondelivers.com\nE-Commerce Software Firm LaGarde Gets $300K in Seed Funds\t mail   top\nLAWRENCE, Kan.

On\nthe economic front, the release of today's modestly upbeat\nretail sales, worse-than-expected industrial output and mildly\ninflationary Producer Price Index data was largely ignored by\ntraders.\nIn equities news, Oracle Corp. (ORCL,11.46,f1) posted fiscal 1Q\nearnings of $0.09 per share late yesterday as stringent\ncost-cutting measures made up for declining revenues, raising\nconcerns about profits going forward. Analysts polled by First\nCall were expecting earnings of $0.08 per share. The company\npostponed its earnings conference call until the first day of\ntrading in U.S. equities resumes.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nTREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY\nTreasuries, which have largely ignored economic reports in\nrecent days, were higher amid the recent turmoil. The U.S.\nretail sales report for August indicated that consumers are\nstill spending. The Commerce Department reported a 0.3% rise in\noverall sales, matching the Dow Jones Newswires forecast.\nExcluding autos, sales rose 0.5%, slightly above expectations.\nJuly retail sales were revised upward to 0.2% growth from the\npreviously reported unchanged. Gasoline stations showed the\nlargest percentage gain, rising 1.4% in August, owing mainly to\nhigher gas prices.\nU.S. industrial output declined for the eleventh-straight month,\naccording to the Federal Reserve, falling 0.8% in August.\nAnalysts per Dow Jones Newswires were looking for a decline of\n0.4%. Capacity utilization fell to 76.2% in August, down from\nJuly's revised 76.9%, the lowest level since July  1983. Despite\nrecent data suggesting otherwise, the manufacturing sector\nappears to be weakening, with a decline in auto production\ndragging down August's industrial production figure.\nFurthermore, the Labor Department reported that the August\nProducer Price Index rose 0.4%, above the Dow Jones Newswires\nforecast of a 0.2% rise. However, excluding food and energy, the\nindex actually declined 0.1% versus analysts' expectations of a\n0.1% rise. So while the initial figures appeared mildly\ninflationary, the upward pressure is primarily confined to the\nvolatile food and energy sectors, while other segments actually\ndeclined.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nWORLD MARKETS\nEuropean markets extended declines as nervous investors took\nprofits going into the weekend amid the uncertainty surrounding\nfuture economic growth and the possibility of a sizeable stock\nmarket decline in the U.S. on Monday. The Bloomberg European 500\nIndex was down late in the day, off 4.96% as of 11:55 a.m. EDT.\nAirlines are also taking a hit again, led by British Airways\n(BAB,39) on concerns that the company's profit outlook will\nsuffer, owing to reduced travel demand. The company was forced\nto cancel all U.S.-bound flights again today.\nThe euro and yen remained in positive territory against the\ndollar, but conceded earlier gains in choppy, thin trading as\ninvestors considered the increased likelihood of worsening\ngrowth in the U.S. and mounting tensions in the Middle East,\namid potential retaliatory attacks by the U.S. Concerns about a\npotential negative impact on the supply of crude oil, should the\nU.S. decide to wage a counter-attack in the region, drove crude\noil higher, despite an OPEC pledge to pump more crude oil as\nnecessary. The November Brent North Sea futures contract traded\nin London was up 4% at $29.50 as of 11:45 a.m. EDT.\nIn Latin America, Brazil's Bovespa Index was down again, falling\n6.39% as of 11:55 a.m. EDT, in tandem with a decline in the\nBrazilian real. Brazil's major index, which has fallen 25% since\nthe beginning of September, has been under pressure in the wake\nof Tuesday's attacks, as investors fear worsening demand and\ndeclining foreign investment will hurt the local economy.\nWilliam Johnson, Market Analyst\n################################################################\nLog in using the links below to:\nAccess your account:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=CCBodyi&NeedCASelValue=Y\nView your Email Alert customization options:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=EAMyAlerts\nPerform research or request a market quote:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=Quotes\nPlace a trade order:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=TradeStock\nTo visit Schwab's home page, use this link:\nhttp://www.schwab.com/\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nTo unsubscribe or modify your Email Alert customization options,\nlog in using the link below or copy and paste it into your\nbrowser's address window:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=EAMyAlerts\nNow you can receive graphics Email Alerts in HTML format,\nusing helpful, full-color graphics and active Web links that\nconnect you directly to information you want.

If you get the objects sequentially\nout of a collection, you can then place them into Page scope, and allow\nthe <jsp:useBean ... /> tag to be used normally within the custom tag.\nBasically you then get a repeating section of JSP script, repeated for\neach object in a collection.\nDon't see how else you do it unless you want to start writing specific\nhtml aware tags like  mytag:doTable   or  mytag:doSelect  etc.\n(and damn I wish I'd blagged a visit to Java One... :( )\n--\nJari Worsley\nSenior Programmer\nHyperlink plc\nTo unsubscribe: mailto listserv@java.sun.com with body:  signoff JSP-INTEREST .\nSome relevant FAQs on JSP/Servlets can be found at:\nhttp://java.sun.com/products/jsp/faq.html\nhttp://www.esperanto.org.nz/jsp/jspfaq.html\nhttp://www.jguru.com/jguru/faq/faqpage.jsp?name=JSP\nhttp://www.jguru.com/jguru/faq/faqpage.jsp?name=Servlets", "output": "Thu, 25 May 2000 - Date, Thu, 25 May 2000 - Date, JSP-INTEREST@JAVA.SUN.COM - Email, Thu, 25 May 2000 - Date, <JSP-INTEREST@java.sun.com> - Email, Thu, 25\nMay 2000 - Date, JSP-INTEREST@java.sun.com - Email, Thu, 25 May 2000 - Date, <NEBBKIPJJMEFNAJODGJCAEPHCAAA.jpreston@stockmaster.com> - Email, <JSP-INTEREST@java.sun.com> - Email, Jim Preston - Person Name, Jari Worsley - Person Name, Hyperlink plc - Organizations, listserv@java.sun.com - Email, http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/faq.html\nhttp://www.esperanto.org.nz/jsp/jspfaq.html\nhttp://www.jguru.com/jguru/faq/faqpage.jsp?name=JSP\nhttp://www.jguru.com/jguru/faq/faqpage.jsp?name=Servlets - URL"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "Hi all,\nRecently some of our employees expressed an interest in attending Weight Watchers and I looked into the  At Work Program  they offer.

BT FINANCE CHIEF SLAMS  PROUD  BOARD MEMBERS\nPhilip Hampton, finance director of debt-ridden British Telecom, has\nattacked decisions taken by other members of the BT board, according to\nreports in the UK press.\nIt is believed that Hampton feels there has been a lack of financial\ndiscipline which led to several acquisitions being made for reasons of what\nhe called  pride. \nHampton pointed to the acquisition of Viag Interkom as particularly\ndamaging, claiming it was too expensive given the mobile network's poor\nstrategic position.\nIn response, a spokesperson for BT said:  He was talking very generally\nrather than specifically. I know he doesn't want to criticise people in the\npast but was trying talk openly about what happened then with the benefit of\nhindsight. \nNevertheless, Hampton's comments will add fuel to already burning hot\nspeculation that BT's BoD is split. Furthermore, some analysts see Hampton's\ncomments as part of a strategy to take over from Peter Bonfield as CE if he\nis forced to stand down.\nBT condemned such notions as  mischief making. \n2.        PHILIPS TO DUMP MOBILE UNIT?\nRoyal Philips Electronics could be selling control of its mobile unit,\naccording to reports in the Dutch press. Gerard Kleisterlee, Philips'\ncurrent COO and CE from May 1, said that a disposal of the unit is certainly\nan option.\nPhilips is looking at all strategic options for the unprofitable unit,\nKleisterlee said, and a good bid to acquire the unit would be considered.\nHowever, he ruled out an acquisition for the unit, saying that the company\nfavours a JV.\n3.        SPAIN - TECNOCOM WINS MADRID UNDERGROUND LICENCE\nTelecomunicaciones y Energia has announced that its Metrocall JV has been\nawarded a C1 mobile licence for use in the Madrid underground.\nThe 60:40 JV, controlled by Tecnocom and Metro de Madrid, plans to invest\nESP9 billion in the next five years to provide mobile service in all parts\nof the underground.\nTecnocom said the venture plans to lease its bandwidth to existing mobile\noperators to allow the companies to provide service to their clients in the\nunderground.\n4.

We're going to get to a point where\nyou will have to move to 3G, as the network will become saturated with all\nthe data being sent. \nBarrett reiterated Nokia's timetable for delivery of 3G handsets. He said\nthe first network trials are already in progress, with mass market take-up\nof handsets forecast for the first half of 2003.\n5.

OMNITEL KEEPS TO ITSELF IN ITALIAN 3G\nOmnitel Italia will not cooperate with rivals in building new wireless\nnetworks in Italy, according to its CE,  Vittorio Colao.\nHowever, Omnitel is willing to rent sections of the network to new phone\ncompanies, Colao said.\n Companies with existing networks aren't scared of building new ones,  Colao\nsaid.  The idea of offering partial use of our networks to other operators\nthrough roaming is a different matter, and entirely practical. \nIn an effort to curb ever-spiralling UMTS costs, operators throughout Europe\nare considering the possibility of network sharing. In Germany, Vodafone,\nDeutsche Telekom and others are seeking regulatory approval to share some\nequipment for the networks they are building.\nOmnitel itself has said that it expects its network to cost between ITL8\ntrillion ($3.6 billion) and ITL10 trillion.\n7.        RUSSIA - 3G LICENCES TO COME BEFORE END OF YEAR?\n3G licences could be issued in Moscow and St Petersburg at the end of this\nyear, according to reports in the Russian press.\nRussia's Ministry of Communications is said to be working on an award\nprocess and it is thought likely that Russia will not have a competitive\nauction. It is understood that two UMTS licences will be awarded in each of\nthe seven federal regions.\nThe cost of a licence remains unclear. However, reports from Moscow suggest\nthat a licence for the capital will cost around $3 million, while a St\nPetersburg licence should go for around $2 million. The price of regional\nlicences has been pencilled at around $1 million.\nThere are already three companies interested in offering 3G services in\nMoscow: MTS, Vimpelcom, and Sonic Duo.\nAs previously reported, according to Sergei Avdeed, VP, network development,\nVimpelCom, the cost of launching a full-scale 3G service in Moscow stands at\naround $500 million.\nSuch high costs could hamper the efforts of Russian companies to stand\nalone, and it has been reported that Yuri Pavlenko of the Ministry of\nCommunications has called for the exclusion of foreign operators not\npartnered with Russian firms.\n8.        SWISSCOM COVERS SOME 3G COSTS WITH REAL ESTATE SALE\nSwisscom is planning to sell 162 properties for CHF1.28 billion ($740\nmillion) to two Swiss property companies as it concentrates on its main\nbusiness activities.\nIt is understood that PSP Real Estate will pay CHF400 million for 22 office\nbuildings, while WTF Holdings will purchase the remaining 140 buildings.\nLehman Brothers owns 80 per cent of newly formed WTF, Swisscom said.\nThe sale follows previously reported news that a consortium led by Credit\nSuisse Asset Management bought 28 Swisscom buildings worth CHF1.27 billion.\n The move by Swisscom to dispose of parts of its real estate portfolio is\naimed at allowing the company to focus on its main business activities, \nSwisscom said in a statement.\nSwisscom, which plans to build a UMTS network, said it will make a net gain\nof CHF500 million from this month's property sales.\n9.

Other employers in the region\nare crying out for people, he said.\n10.      INFOSTRADA SALE HELPS VODAFONE TO BEAT DEBT TARGET\nVodafone has said that has passed its debt reduction target after selling\nits stake in Italian company Infostrada.\nVodafone believes its debt figure, currently around GBP7 billion, is now\nlower than most of its rivals following the closure of the long-awaited deal\nin Italy.\nChris Gent said that the sale means that Vodafone has now exceeded its\ntarget of cutting debt to at least GBP10 billion by the end of March.\nThe figure had stood at more than GBP13 billion in September but the sale of\nVodafone's stake in France Telecom for GBP7 billion helped the cause last\nmonth.\n11.      BT STILL PLANNING TO CUT STAKE IN MAXIS\nBritish Telecom is still considering reducing its 33.3 per cent stake in\nMaxis, as part of its restructuring exercise to streamline its business in\nJapan and Western Europe.\nHarry James, VP, PR & media, BT Services (Singapore), said:  Our objective\nis to reduce our existing debts to GBP10 billion March 31, 2002, and as a\nconsequent we are evaluating our assets which could mean downsizing other\nregions that do not fall in our focus areas of main interest. \nJames said  enormous expenditure to kickstart 3G  means that other options\nhave to be considered to cut down on costs. Those options include\n downsizing some operations,  he said.\nNevertheless, since Japan is currently the biggest market for wireless\ntelecom for Asia, BT will continue its aggressive marketing and business\nplans there, he said.\nBT's business interest in Malaysia could include working together with local\ncompanies via joint partnership in developing new technologies, James said.\n12.

VODAFONE AND VERIZON PRESENT UNITED FRONT\nVodafone and Verizon have said that recent rumours that the companies are\nclashing over 3G standards, or that Vodafone is seeking to acquire control\nof their US JV Verizon Wireless, are  mere speculation. \nIn a joint statement, Verizon said the two have an  excellent working\nrelationship  and they plan on continuing to build Verizon Wireless\ntogether.\nVodafone said that any choice of future technology will be in the interest\nof both parties and with full awareness of the evolving technology trends in\nthe wireless industry.\nAs previously reported, it is understood that Verizon Wireless wanted to\ndeploy an alternative technology to the WCDMA being deployed in Europe by\nVodafone and most other European operators.\n15.

ELEKTRIM PLANS PLZ300B BOND ISSUE\nElektrim's BoD has approved a PLZ300 million issue of registered, class A\nbonds to be secured by a pledge on up to 4.9 per cent of its stake in\ntelecom subsidiary Elektrim Telekomunikacja.\nThe company's BoD selected Austria's Raiffeisen Investment as underwiter and\nissue agent for the bond, which will be offered to banks and other financial\ninstitutions and not publicly traded. The paper will carry a maturity of 367\ndays and bear interest of 19.5 per cent per annum, the company said.\nAccording to the terms of the bond issue, the BoD pledged to maintain its 51\nper cent controlling stake in Elektrim Telekomunikacja, the statement said.\nBondholders will have the right for early redemption if this obligation is\ninfringed.\nThe planned bond issue amounts to 7.6 per cent of Elektrim's equity, which\nwould bring the total ratio of issued and unredeemed bonds to 53.4 per cent\nof Elektrim's equity.\nThe announcement signals another move by Elektrim's beleaguered BoD to raise\ncash for the financially struggling company.\nElektrim is currently embroiled in a boardroom battle between Vivendi and\nDeutsche Telekom over control of Elektrim's key asset, Polish mobile\noperator Polska Telefonia Cyfrowa.\nDT currently holds 45 per cent of PTC, while Vivendi has a 49 per cent stake\nin Elektrim Telekomunikacja, which owns 51 per cent of the mobile operator.\nElektrim is planning a preliminary deal to sell its cable making subsidiary\nElektrim Kable to domestic rival Krakowska Fabryka Kabli for about $92\nmillion.\nThat sale, plus the PLZ300 billion bond issue, are both badly needed to\ncover Elektrim's share of EUR250 million in 3G licence payments this year,\nas well as additional costs.\n20.

Asian markets suffered\nthe most damage with Japan's Nikkei 225 Index plummeting 6.63%\nby the close of trading. The Nikkei closed below 10,000 for the\nfirst time in roughly 18 years, after reaching a pinnacle of\nnearly 40,000 in December of 1989. European markets, which had\nincurred substantial declines yesterday after the horrific\nincidents, stabilized somewhat. Bloomberg's European 500 Index\nwas down 0.10% as of 8:59 a.m. EDT. Investors sought the safety\nof defensive issues such as energy and pharmaceutical stocks,\nwhile insurance and airline stocks sold off as might be\nexpected.\nThe world watched in stunned silence last night as President\nBush addressed the nation and attempted to alleviate fears and\nrestore confidence in the government, national security, and the\nfinancial infrastructure, which is suffering widespread\nrepercussions from yesterday's surreal events. His closing\nremarks addressed the fact that the  resolve of the U.S. has\nbeen tested.  President Bush said that  we will show the world\nthat we will pass this test.  The international community echoed\nBush's sentiment as leaders of the world's largest countries\ndenounced yesterday's  cowardly  terrorist acts.\nIn an attempt to stabilize financial markets around the globe,\nlarge central banks injected $80 billion in liquidity into the\nbanking system, with the European Central Bank  allocating\napproximately $63 billion, while the Bank of Japan pumped almost\n$17 billion into money markets. The actions suggest that the\nworld's largest central banks may further lower interest rates\nin an effort to avert a global recession, though the ECB's\nPresident Wim Duisenberg said that it would be premature to\npredict what the ultimate economic ramifications will be and\nthat an immediate rate cut may only provoke a reaction of panic\nrather than of calmness and stability.\nIn a symbolic testament to international belief in the continued\nstrength of the U.S., the U.S. dollar recouped some of\nyesterday's losses as it traded slightly higher against the euro\nand unchanged versus the yen on the heels of the global\ncommunity's willingness to standby and provide liquidity as\nneeded. In another sign of stability, oil backed off of\nyesterday's highs caused by speculation that heightened tensions\nin the Middle East may impact the world's supply of crude oil.\nThe front-month Brent North Sea futures contract traded in\nLondon backed off 1% to $28.77.\nThe Federal Reserve may decide to make an inter-meeting cut in\nrates as well as many fear that consumer confidence and spending\nbehavior, the one leg still holding up the table of the U.S.\neconomy, will falter in the wake of yesterday's attacks, much in\nthe same way as it did after the commencement of the Persian\nGulf War in 1991. Meanwhile, U.S.\tmarkets remained closed the\nU.S. Government and the Federal Reserve attempt to sort out the\nfinancial chaos that could potentially ensue.\nWilliam Johnson, Market Analyst\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nTREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY\nNo further information available at this time.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nWORLD MARKETS\nNo further information available at this time.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nFUTURES WATCH\nNo further information available at this time.\n################################################################\nLog in using the links below to:\nAccess your account:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=CCBodyi&NeedCASelValue=Y\nView your Email Alert customization options:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=EAMyAlerts\nPerform research or request a market quote:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=Quotes\nPlace a trade order:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=TradeStock\nTo visit Schwab's home page, use this link:\nhttp://www.schwab.com/\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nTo unsubscribe or modify your Email Alert customization options,\nlog in using the link below or copy and paste it into your\nbrowser's address window:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=EAMyAlerts\nNow you can receive graphics Email Alerts in HTML format,\nusing helpful, full-color graphics and active Web links that\nconnect you directly to information you want.

Have a good weekend!\nPeople come into your life for a reason, a season, or a\nlifetime. When you figure out which it is, you know\nexactly what to do. When someone is in your life for a\nREASON, it is usually to meet a need you have\nexpressed outwardly or inwardly.  They have come to assist\nyou through a difficulty, to provide you with guidance\nand support, to aid you physically, emotionally, or\nspiritually. They may seem like a godsend, and they\nare. They are there for the reason you need them to be.\nThen, without any wrong doing on your part or at an\ninconvenient time, this person will say or do\nsomething to bring the relationship to the end.\nSometimes they die. Sometimes they walk away.\nSometimes they act up or out and force you to take a\nstand. What we  must realize is that our need has been met,\nour desire fulfilled; their work is done. The prayer you sent up\nhas been answered and it is now  time to move on.\nWhen people come into your life for a SEASON, it is\nbecause your turn has come to share, grow, or learn.\nThey may bring you an experience of peace or make you\nlaugh. They may teach you something you have never\ndone. They usually give you an unbelievable amount of\njoy. Believe it!  It is real!  But, only for a season.\nLIFETIME relationships teach you lifetime lessons;\nthose things you must build upon in order to have a\nsolid emotional foundation. Your job is to accept the\nlesson, love the person/people (anyway); and put what\nyou have learned to use in all other relationships and\nareas of your life. It is said that love is blind but\nfriendship is clairvoyant.\nThank you for being a part of my life...Smile and stop\nhere if you're not into this final part:\nThis is to show people you love them and to see how many people\nlove you!! Don't feel embarrassed because only you\nwill get the results.\nSend it to every friend that you have online,\nincluding the person who sent it  to you.\n0 Replies = you may need to work on your people skills\n2 Replies = you are nice but probably need to be more  outgoing.\n4 Replies = you have picked your friends well\n6 Replies = you are downright popular\n8 Replies or More = you are totally awesome (and\nprobably know why you're on MY list)!\nThere is nothing attached.\nJust send this to (4) people and see what happens on\nthe fourth day.

Interesting to read the fact these guys don't think Larry really gets it when it comes to wireless.\nRon\nNew Oracle Spin-Off First to Market With Consumer Wireless Internet Portal\nOracle Corp. today announced the formation of OracleMobile.com, a wholly-owned subsidiary, offering the first comprehensive consumer wireless Internet portal. The portal is based on Oracle's Portal-to-Go technology platform and offers personalized business and lifestyle services free of charge. The most popular Internet content and commerce services are teaming with OracleMobile.com, including AllSites.com, Amazon.com, Astrology.com, eBay, E*TRADE, Hollywood.com, KDFC, Lottery.com, MapQuest.com, OpenTable.com, Sabre, Sabre BTS, Travelocity.com, ScreamingMedia, SmarTraveler, SnoCountry, SysTran Software, The Weather Channel, UPS, Waiter.com, and ZAGAT.com. The OracleMobile.com service can be accessed from Web-enabled wireless devices, such as Web-phones, and two-way pagers.\nOracle also announced that it has selected Motorola to provide key services to OracleMobile.com, such as wireless messaging, address book,  to-do  lists, calendar services and Internet access via voice command.\n<http://www.oracle.com/corporate/press/index.html?136045.html>\nASG Analysis -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nThis is a significant announcement because of the resources and scope that Oracle has pledged this new company. Larry Ellison pointed out that Phone.com was a key competitor in the wireless carrier segment. However, he went much farther defining additional segments they would go after: large portal tools and software, hosting for large and medium businesses, and a consumer portal. Oracle already powers nearly all of the major Internet portals (except IBM's) so they have a definite advantage in getting customers. The initial list of companies  teaming with OracleMobile.com  is impressive. If these are actually customers they have a big lead in this segment.

The top 10 media\ncompanies garnered 76% of total revenues, estimated at $3.76\nbillion. In 2000, the top 10 firms accounted for 70% of\nrevenues.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nReal Networks shows all-in-one player\nRealNetworks  will unveil a new service Monday combining its\nsoftware programs, which play Internet audio and video and let\npeople record, organize and play music on their computers.\nRealOne combines the company's RealPlayer and Real Jukebox\nfunctions. A  preview version  of the new player is being\noffered free. In about two months a new version will be\navailable. It will include additional features and subscription\nprogramming costing $9.95 a month. RealNetworks also announced\nGoldPass, its 1-year-old premium content service, has 400,000\nsubscribers. The company's entry into the online music\nsubscription business, MusicNet, will be available through\nRealOne for an additional fee.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nE-commerce spending revives\nOnline retail sales were nearly normal in the week after the\nterrorist attacks, according to researcher BizRate.com. The\nanalysts estimated the value of sales at $82.5 million, which\nwas 85% of what the analysts consider a normal week.  Online\nsales rebounded back to healthy levels this week as Americans\nreturned to work and resumed their normal shopping habits,  said\nBizRate.com President Chuck Davis.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nNapster near license deal\nNapster Inc. is reportedly near concluding a licensing contract\nwith the Harry Fox Agency, which represents most U.S. music\npublishers.

We have sent out this procedures every month, but the expense reports from your department are consistently problematic. This requires a lot of extra time on our part to process these expense reports and creates delay for the payments. These procedures will allow us to process your department's expense reports in a timely manner and will also help to build good credit for the company.\nThank you in advance for your assistance.\nAlice\nGuidelines for handling expenses and invoices.\n1) Expense reports must be submitted to Accounts Payable each month, accompanied by original receipts. Please turn your reports in no later than 5 days past the end of the month.  If you have a significant amount of expenses on a regular basis, try to submit your expense report more frequently, say weekly or twice a month.\n2) Never include more than one month's expenses on a single expense report. Fill out a separate report for each month.\n3) For all travelers, before you submit your travel expenses we need two things. 1) For your airline ticket we need your payment information, boarding pass and the original travel agency invoice. 2) For hotel reservations we need your original receipt for the hotel and proof of payment. If you don't have the information required, your expense will require extra attention and special processing that will delay your reimbursement.\n4) If anyone holding company corporate credit card. Please do not mix expense with any other personal credit card. You need to submit separate expense reports.\nPlease turn your expenses at least once a month if not more frequently. Don't accumulate months worth of expenses and turn them all in at once.

In an effort to calm nervous investors,\nthe Federal Reserve announced a 50-basis-point cut in the\nfederal funds rate this morning. The Fed also commented that it\nwould continue to provide massive liquidity as necessary to\nensure smooth market operations. European markets vaulted higher\non the news while the dollar remained volatile against the euro\nand yen.\nThe Federal Reserve reported that it has cut both the federal\nfunds and discount rates by 50 basis points in a move to thwart\nany decline in consumer sentiment owing to Tuesday's horrific\nevents. The move was widely-expected and speculation that the\nother major central banks of the world will cut rates, as well,\nabounds.\nOn the equity front, U.S. airlines stocks may take a beating\ntoday as most of the major carriers, already suffering enormous\nlosses due to a severely reduced flight schedule over the last\nweek, announced that they will be forced to cut back flights by\nas much as 20% of their previous schedules and consider\ncost-cutting measures such as layoffs. In a move to avoid\nbankruptcy, Continental Airlines (CAL,40) announced that it will\nlayoff 12,000 workers as the company's CEO predicted 100,000 job\nlosses in the U.S. airline industry alone.\nInsurance companies have warned that losses could reach into the\ntens of billions as a result of Tuesday's terrorist attacks upon\nthe World Trade Center.  American International Group (AIG,74)\nsaid it expects losses to reach $500 million, while Axa SA\n(AXA,24), one of the world's largest insurers, said it sees $300\nmillion to $400 million in claims that will affect its bottom\nline. Dow component General Electric Co. (GE,40,f2) said that\nits 3Q profit will fall below the Street's previous estimate as\nthe company forecasts roughly $400 million in losses at its\nreinsurance business.\nAuto stocks could also see some selling pressure following\nFord's (F,19.40,f2) announcement that it will fall short of the\nStreet's 3Q earnings forecast and that it will further reduce\nproduction, due to parts shortages incurred as a result of\nrestrictive transportation issues in the wake of last Tuesday's\nevents.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nTREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY\nTreasuries, which were lower earlier, continued to back off from\nlast week's gains following the Fed's pre-emptive rate cut\nannouncement this morning. In addition to the rate cut\nannouncement, the Fed, which has provided adequate additional\nliquidity to the markets over the past week, has confirmed that\nit will continue to add unusually large amounts of liquidity to\nensure smooth, orderly operations across the global marketplace.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nWORLD MARKETS\nEuropean bourses, which were trading down earlier, jumped into\npositive territory after the Federal Reserve announced a\n50-basis-point cut in the federal funds rate, as investors\nremained cautious ahead of this morning's stock market\nre-opening in the U.S. The Bloomberg European 500 Index was up\n0.27% as of 8:55 a.m. EDT. Insurance issues recouped some of\nlast week's losses, and investors also sought defensive stocks\nsuch as pharmaceuticals and energy, while financial services and\nretail stocks led the decliners. The euro continued its recent\nuptrend against the U.S. dollar as speculation mounts that the\ngreater likelihood of a U.S. recession will discourage foreign\ninflows into the world's largest economy.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nFUTURES WATCH\nAsian markets plunged lower as many investors anticipated a\nsimilar slide in U.S. equity markets, which have yet to\ncompensate for the effects of last Tuesday's tragedy. Japan's\nNikkei-225 Index closed down 5.04% caused by the growing fear of\na global recession. Exporters and airline stocks were lower.\nDespite a FOREX intervention by Japan's government and the Bank\nof Japan to weaken the yen this morning, the Japanese currency\nrebounded against the dollar. Crude oil remained at higher\nlevels amid concerns about heightening tensions in the Middle\nEast.\nWilliam Johnson, Market Analyst\n################################################################\nLog in using the links below to:\nAccess your account:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=CCBodyi&NeedCASelValue=Y\nView your Email Alert customization options:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=EAMyAlerts\nPerform research or request a market quote:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=Quotes\nPlace a trade order:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=TradeStock\nTo visit Schwab's home page, use this link:\nhttp://www.schwab.com/\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nTo unsubscribe or modify your Email Alert customization options,\nlog in using the link below or copy and paste it into your\nbrowser's address window:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=EAMyAlerts\nNow you can receive graphics Email Alerts in HTML format,\nusing helpful, full-color graphics and active Web links that\nconnect you directly to information you want.

(MU,21,f2), reported a fiscal\n4Q loss, excluding items, of $0.28 per share, ahead of the First\nCall consensus of a $0.33 per share loss, as revenues declined\n79%. The company blamed a global slump in demand for personal\ncomputers for its woes as DRAM prices have plummeted over the\nlast year. Going forward, executives at Micron said they still\nexpect a seasonal pickup in the coming weeks, but warned that\nconsumer demand has been tempered somewhat by the terrorist\nattacks.\nEnergy and utility company Entergy Corp. (ETR,35) reported that\nit expects to meet or beat the Street's forecast for its 3Q\noperating profits of $1.17 per share. The company confirmed\nearlier guidance for both 2001 and 2002 and said that it expects\nstrength in its nuclear segment in 3Q.\nAircraft, automobile and industrial products manufacturer\nTextron Inc. (TXT,43) lowered its 3Q and 4Q earnings forecasts\ndue to the recent attacks in the U.S. and an already weakening\neconomy. The company now expects a 3Q loss of $0.25 per share\nversus the First Call mean estimate of a $0.71 per share profit.\nTextron anticipates a 4Q profit of $0.40-$0.60 per share, lower\nthan the First Call consensus forecast for $1.05 per share.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, telecommunications\nequipment maker Lucent Technologies (LU,5.74,f2) is looking for\na buyer for its Octel messaging unit, citing people familiar\nwith the situation. Lucent previously spun off part of the Octel\nunit, which it acquired for $1.8 billion, as Avaya Inc.\n(AV,10.69,f2).\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nTREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY\nBonds were mixed in early trading, with weakness on the\nshort-end amid strength in equity index futures this morning. No\nsalient economic news is slated for release today. Speaking at a\nbreakfast meeting in New York this morning, Treasury Secretary\nPaul O'Neill commented that the terrorist attacks had prolonged\nan economic recovery by a  quarter or so.  He cautioned that\nmore time is necessary to fully gauge the economic impact of the\nattacks, and said fiscal policy needs to be  careful and\ndeliberate. \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nWORLD MARKETS\nEuropean markets were higher with the Bloomberg European 500\nIndex up 1.9% as of 8:55 a.m. EDT. Chemical stocks continued\ntheir recent strength as the prospects for increasing profit\nmargins have improved due to sliding crude oil prices. One of\nEurope's biggest utilities, RWE AG (RWEOY,37,f1), reported that\noperating profits would come in ahead of analysts' estimates.\nMeanwhile, Lloyd's of London says its reinsurance losses owing\nto the attacks in the U.S. will amount to $1.9 billion. Telecom\nequipment and autos were lower.\nAsian markets were mixed with Japan's Nikkei-225 Index shedding\n0.54% on weakness in oil and mining stocks. Exporters were also\nsofter on the heels of yesterday's lower-than-expected consumer\nconfidence report in the U.S. Chemicals and insurance stocks led\nto the upside. The dollar was higher against the yen and the\neuro after Japan's finance minister reported that it had\nconducted another currency intervention to weaken the yen. The\nEuropean Central Bank confirmed the intervention, saying that it\nhad purchased euros against the yen as part of its agreement\nwith Japan. Despite an American Petroleum Institute report\nshowing a big increase in gasoline inventories for the latest\nweek, crude oil was steady this morning as several OPEC\nministers commented that the recent weakness in crude prices was\nspeculative and that OPEC could work toward preserving the\ncurrent price band, though another production cut is not\nexpected.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nFUTURES WATCH\nIn the December Globex futures contract as of 8:55 a.m. EDT, the\nS&P 500 Index was up 5 points (8 points above fair value), while\nthe Nasdaq 100 Index was up 9 points (15 points above fair\nvalue). The December DJIA futures contract was up 35 points (52\npoints above fair value), and the October crude oil futures\ntraded on the NYMEX were up $0.04 at $21.85/barrel.\nWilliam Johnson Market Analyst\n################################################################\nLog in using the links below to:\nAccess your account:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=CCBodyi&NeedCASelValue=Y\nView your Email Alert customization options:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=EAMyAlerts\nPerform research or request a market quote:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=Quotes\nPlace a trade order:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=TradeStock\nTo visit Schwab's home page, use this link:\nhttp://www.schwab.com/\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nTo unsubscribe or modify your Email Alert customization options,\nlog in using the link below or copy and paste it into your\nbrowser's address window:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=EAMyAlerts\nNow you can receive graphics Email Alerts in HTML format,\nusing helpful, full-color graphics and active Web links that\nconnect you directly to information you want.

Talk to AC about the issue and develop a customized solution for them (e.g. Are they ready for some further on-site training in KC or NJ?)\n5.

If you need to build a page that is made up of several different\n>  data sets  (objects anybody?), you'd need to create a single XML document\n> that contained all of these data sets so that one XSLT could transform based\n> on them all.\nAgreed. That's why I was thinking about using JSPs to produce the appropriate XML\n(from diferent sources and pre-formatting the data if necessary) so the XSL job is\neasier.\n> Also, who creates the XML documents?  It no doubt is a bean.  What's the\n> point of having the bean convert data into a somewhat expensive XML document\n> on the server, just to have the XSLT on the server do the transform.\nThe reason why I'm doing so is because after I've finished producing the XML from\nthe data, I can let designers play with the interface and I don't need to bother\nany technical people again, until the data model changes. Of course, assuming your\ndesigners can play with XML and XSL but I'd rather train a designer to do so, which\nhe can also apply to other things, than teach him JSP, that he cannot apply on many\nother areas, or than having a developer spending time re-adjusting the JSP every\ntime the UI changes.\n> This may be much more powerful in the future when browsers and the like can\n> take the XML+XSLT and do the work on its own end, but that's generally not\n> the case now.\nI'm not convinced that sending both documents to the client to be processed there\nis the solution. Why send the  whole  XML document and the  whole  XSL document\nthrought the network and then get into client-compatibility issued when you already\nknow what to send in the server? Network bandwitdh and client compatibility issues\nmake me very cautious about that.\n> XML documents are best used when they are being sent to other computer\n> systems -- since XML is a nice data transfer syntax in a heterogeneous\n> world.  Building and parsing DOM/XML is pretty expensive for just internal\n> server representation.\nAgreed.

BT DROPS NETCO SCHEME - PLANNING GBP10M RIGHTS ISSUE?\nBritish Telecom has dropped plans to create a new UK company, NetCo,\naccording to reports in the UK press.\nIt is understood that BT is now considering a GBP10 billion rights issue -\nby far the biggest in the history of the UK.\nThe plan to create NetCo, which was to run BT's UK network, was part of the\nmajor restructuring unveiled last year.\nIt is believed that incoming BT chairman Christopher Bland has already\nsuggested that he is prepared to re-evaluate BT's move to divide itself into\nfive separate divisions.\nSpeculation is growing now that the massive issue will be accompanied by the\nproposal to demerge the mobile subsidiary BT Wireless, through a bonus issue\nin the new company to BT investors.\nHowever, it seems that BT has no intention of selling its stake in Japan\nTelecom or its cellular affiliate J-Phone.\nMeanwhile, a report in the Financial Mail on Sunday said that BT carried out\na since-abandoned search in the US to find a replacement for Peter Bonfield,\nthe group's CE.\nIt is understood, though, that the headhunters were called off following the\ndecision by chairman Iain Vallance to step down to be replaced by Bland.\n2.        E-PLUS CONFIRMS ERICSSON, LUCENT, GROUP 3G TIE-UPS\nGerman mobile operator E-Plus has confirmed that its parent, KPN Mobile, has\nselected Ericsson and Lucent Technologies to build E-Plus's UMTS.\nAs reported, Ericsson and Lucent also won the order to construct the UMTS\nnetwork for KPN Mobile in the Netherlands and in Belgium. A LOI to this\neffect has now been signed, with the total order worth EUR200 million for\nthe first two years.\nE-Plus said it will be able to offer its customers first UMTS services from\nthe end of 2002.\nE-Plus also said that it had reached a contract to rent out its GSM network\ncapacity with Group 3G, a JV between Telefonica Moviles and Sonera. The\ncontract will start autumn 2001 and run until 2012.\nSonera had already said in association with the release of its Q1 results\nthat it planned to sign this deal with E-Plus. Now, though, it has actually\nput pen to paper earlier than expected.\nUwe Bergheim, CEO, E-Plus, said that additional revenues from the tie-up\nwill have a positive impact on Dutch majority shareholder, KPN Mobile.\nBergheim said that the sums involved in these deals ran into billions of\nmarks.\nHowever, a UMTS network for Germany has been estimated at around EUR5\nbillion and EUR6 billion, and KPN's sum of EUR200 million for three\ncountries seems significantly lower.\nLucent and Ericsson will supply 3,200 base stations for KPN's mobile\nnetwork. This should allow for the construction of a UMTS network in about\n10 major cities.\n3.        CROWN CASTLE PAYS $380M FOR 40PC RAIWAY STAKE\nCrown Castle International has announced that its subsidiary, CCR, has\nagreed to purchase a 49 per cent interest in RaiWay, a subsidiary of\nRadiotelevisione Italiana, the Italian state-owned television and radio\nbroadcaster, for approximately $380 million.\nRaiWay employs over 750 people and manages over 2,300 broadcast transmission\nsites across Italy, representing Italy's largest broadcast tower network.\nKey terms of the transaction include a television and radio broadcast\ntransmission contract with RAI through 2014 and Crown Castle's right to\nappoint the chairman and the business development officer who will oversee\nthe marketing of RaiWay's towers to wireless tenants.\nCrown Castle expects that Poste Italiane, the Italian state-owned post\noffice service, will purchase five per cent of Crown Castle's interest in\nRaiWay for approximately $19 million in cash.\nCONTACT:        Benjamin Moreland, Crown Castle International\nTEL: +1 713 570 3000\n4.      ALCATEL ASKS FOR EUR7B LOAN TO FUND LUCENT BID\nAlcatel has approached Banque Nationale de Paris, Credit Suisse First Boston\nand Deutsche Bank for a EUR7 billion loan to finance its bid for Lucent\nTechnologies's optical-fiber unit.\nSerge Tchuruk, CE, Alcatel, has confirmed that Alcatel had bid for the unit.\nLucent is selling the business, which should fetch around $5 billion, to add\ncash and focus on its phone-equipment business.\nAs reported, however, speculation has been growing that Alcatel has been\nholding behind-the-scenes preliminary discussions with Lucent about a\nfull-blown acquisition or merger of the two companies.\nReports from the US have revealed that Lucent, which has never been willing\nto sell, could be open to a  merger of equals  structure. And analysts\nbelieve that since both Lucent and Alcatel boast a market capitalization of\nroughly $35 billion, such a scenario is financially plausible.\n5.        INFINEON BUYS CATAMARAN FOR $250M IN STOCK\nInfineon Technologies, the semiconductor unit of Siemens, has agreed to buy\nUS chip developer Catamaran Communications for $250 million in stock.\nCalifornia-based Catamaran, which was founded in 1999, has no production\nplants of its own.\nSiemens said Catamaran, a specialist in integrated circuits for new high\nspeed optical communications networks, would help it gain a leading position\nin the growing market for high speed line cards and optical networking\nchips.\nThe move follows previously reported news that Infineon's memory chip\ndivision posted a Q2 loss before interest and taxes of EUR134 million versus\na profit of EUR193 million in the year-ago period. Prices for DRAM chips\nhave fallen to less than $3 in recent months.\n With the acquisition of Catamaran Communications, we are continuing to\nfollow our strategy of expanding Infineon's leading position in the\ncommunications sector,  said Ulrich Schumacher, CE, Infineon.\nInfineon said there were strong synergies between its fibre optics and high\nspeed communications solutions and Catamaran's optical networking products.\nIt described Catamaran, a start-up with about 50 employees founded in\nNovember 1999, as an emerging leader in integrated circuits for the next\ngeneration 40 gbps and 10 gbps optical network markets.\n6.        INCOMING BT CHAIRMAN SAYS 3G LICENCE BID WAS MISTAKE\nChristopher Bland, British Telecom's new chairman, has said that the\ndebt-laden telecoms giant should never have bid for a 3G licence in the UK.\nAfter an auction last year, BT shelled out some GBP4 billion for a 3G\nlicence, and last week chairman Iain Vallance paid for it with his job, some\nobservers believe.\nThe massive bid helped to saddle the former monopoly with three times as\nmuch debt, shrinking profits, a lower credit rating and investors calling\nfor CE Peter Bonfield to follow Vallance.\nBland predicted that in the next few months an existing licence holder will\nsell the rights to its 3G licence at a knock-down price. However, he is not\ncritical of BT's BoD for bidding for a licence.  Hindsight is a wonderful\nthing,  Bland said.\n7.        UK OPERATORS HOPE TO CASH IN ON ATMS\nUK mobile operators are in talks with cash machine network Link, about\nenabling their customers to top up prepaid accounts at cash dispensers.\nIt is understood that a service encompassing 32,000 ATMs could be up and\nrunning within 12 months.\nIt is thought that Orange and Vodafone have both agreed in principle to the\nATM venture, although Link has said that discussions about the commercial\nterms are still at an early stage.\nNews of the talks are likely to renew speculation about the mobile operators\n' ambitions to move into financial services.\nOrange has denied rumours that it has considered applying for a UK banking\nlicence. However, European legislators are considering plans to allow mobile\ncompanies to become financial institutions without the need for banking\nlicences.\n8.        MOTOROLA CHIEFS' BONUSES SPARK UP FRESH ROW IN UK\nThe controversy surrounding the closure of Motorola plant in Bathgate in\nScotland has escalated following news that five senior Motorola executives\nreceived bonuses worth more than GBP2.5 million just weeks before the\ncompany shut the plant.\nA company spokesperson said the performance related pay-outs to the top\nbosses was necessary to keep  key talent  in the boardroom.\nHowever, unions will no doubt be unimpressed with this evaluation. The\nbonuses were made at the beginning of April, three weeks before the\nannouncement of 3,100 jobs losses with the closure of the plant.\nUnder the scheme, company president Robert Growney was given a GBP610,000\nbonus on top of his annual salary of GBP680,000. Chairman Christopher\nGalvin, meanwhile, received a GBP870,000 bonus to go with his annual salary\nof GBP890,000.\nFrederick Tucker and Keith Bane, both VPs, were awarded bonuses of\nGBP380,000 each while finance chief, Carl Koenemann, received GBP310,000.\nNegotiations are ongoing over the level of redundancy payments for workers\nat the plant but it is thought they will get around GBP1,300 for each year\nof service.\nA company spokesperson said that while there was a downturn in the mobile\nbusiness,  other parts of the company will be going from strength to\nstrength .\nMeanwhile,  UK Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has come under fire for his\ncomments that the closure was a  human tragedy. \nHis comments led a fellow Westminster minister to attack him for pandering\nto the old left in Scotland, while Tam Dalyell, the local Labour MP, claimed\nhis comments might put at risk the remaining Motorola jobs in Scotland.\n9.      VIRGIN MOBILE TO LAUNCH CUSTOMER LOYALTY SCHEME\nMobile users could be rewarded for their loyalty in a similar way to\nsupermarket shoppers under a new scheme set to be unveiled by Virgin Mobile.\nThe company is planning to offer rewards to people who spend more than GBP30\nper month on calls. Customers will get back 10 per cent of their bill, which\ncan be spent on future calls.\nThe average mobile bill in the UK is GBP42 per month so the scheme will save\na typical customer about GBP50 per year.\nThe only condition is that customers signing up for the loyalty scheme must\nagree to pay their bills by direct debit, or prepaid with a credit or debit\ncard.\nSteven Day of Virgin Mobile said:  Consumers are rewarded for their loyalty\nvirtually everywhere else - so why not for mobile phones? We are hoping to\nshake up the industry in a similar way to Tesco when it introduced the first\nsupermarket loyalty card. \nOther operators are expected to introduce similar loyalty schemes in the\ncoming months.\nHowever, Vodafone has dismissed the Virgin scheme. It said:  Our customers\nwould rather pay lower call charges than get loyalty rewards. \n10.      SONERA CUTS 70 JOBS AT ZED MOBILE PORTAL\nSonera has said that it is to reduce staff at its Zed mobile portal unit by\n70 this year. The reductions apply to the whole unit, which employs a total\nof 400 persons, the company said in a statement.\nThe company said the lay-offs were caused by a delay in the launch of its\nproducts in its main markets in the UK, Turkey, and Germany. Sonera said\nthat these delays will cause Zed's sales this year to fall short of earlier\ntargets.\nThe news follow cuts at Sonera's other value-added unit, SmartTrust, which\ntwo months ago said that it would reduce its own staff by 120 persons during\n2001.\n11.      MORE MOBILE SUBS CAN'T STOP PT PROFITS FALLING 6.7PC\nMobile services in Portugal and Brazil have accounted for a growing portion\nof Portugal Telecom's revenue, it has been revealed - but not enough to stop\nPT profit from falling 6.7 per cent.\nPT announced that sales in its TMN mobile unit climbed 33 per cent to EUR310\nmillion. Its EBITDA, meanwhile, increased 30.5 per cent to EUR110 million.\nTMN added 206,300 to its customer base ending the quarter with over 3.1\nmillion customers, a rise of 41.8 per cent over the same period last year.\nARPU was EUR29.\nHowever, PT said that overall Q1 profit fell 6.7 per cent as operating costs\ngrew faster than revenue.\nNet income fell to EUR133 million from EUR142.4 million a year earlier.\nAnalysts had been expecting a net income of around EUR127.8 million.\nRevenue rose 33 per cent to EUR1.18 billion, while operating costs surged 46\nper cent to EUR988 million.

ERICSSON TROUBLES WON'T CRIPPLE SWEDISH ECONOMY\nSwedish Finance Minister Boose Ringholm has said that he believes the\nSwedish economy will grow by 2.7 per cent this year and 2.6 per cent next\nyear, in spite of the difficulties being experienced by Ericsson, the\ncountry's largest company.\nRingholm's comments came as Ericsson lost its position as the third largest\nmanufacturer of mobile handsets to Siemens. The company had previously\nannounced a $482 million pretax loss for Q1, and is cutting its workforce by\n22,000.\n It's serious if the biggest company in your country has a lot of problems, \nRingholm said.  But our forecast about growth will not be changed by\ndevelopments at Ericsson. \nRingholm gave his approval to Ericsson's handset tie-up with Sony, saying\nthat Ericsson needs to build international alliances.\n In the long term I'm not so worried, I know there is good strength in the\ncompany and it will be successful if it increases its international\nactivities,  Ringholm said.\nThe Swedish economy has slowed from a growth rate of 3.6 per cent last year,\nlargely as a result of falling exports to the US and other markets hit by\nthat country's economic slowdown.\n16.

ANALYSTS DON'T SPARE SIEMENS AS THEY CUT PRICE TARGETS\nSiemens has been dealt a blow by four investment banks, as it suffered\ndowngrades following news of a sharp drop in Q2 earnings from its\nInformation and Communications\ndivision which covers telecoms networks and mobiles.\nThe downgrades came as Siemens said it would cut 3,500 jobs from the\ndivision as part of a package of measures to restore profitability but it\nsaid it was no longer in a position to give a results forecast for the rest\nof the year.\nSchroder Salomon Smith Barney cut its investment rating on Siemens from\n buy  to  medium  and reduced its price target from EUR170 to EUR130.\n We think that Siemens remains an attractive longer-term restructuring\nsituation but that its relative defensiveness is now under threat\nshort-term,  SSSB said in research note.\nGoldman Sachs cut its 2001 earnings per share view forecast by 12 per cent\nto EUR4.15 and its 2002 forecasts by 14 per cent to 5.45.\nDresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein cut its rating to  reduce  from  hold , and\nissued a price target of EUR110, while UBS Warburg cut its price target to\nEUR100 from 112, reiterating its  hold  rating\n20.      SOUTH AFRICA - LICENCE REVIEW PUT BACK TO MAY 9\nThe judicial review of the tender process for South Africa's third mobile\nlicence has been moved from May 2, and will now start on May 9.\nA spokesperson for losing bidder NextCom said that the delay will allow the\njudge time to read through newly submitted evidence.\nMany observers have suggested that the uncertainty surrounding the award of\nthe permit has spoiled South Africa's image at a time when it is opening up\nthe telecoms market to competition and ahead of the Q4 IPO of Telkom.\nThe judicial review was ordered by the High Court last year after NextCom\ncomplained that government officials had tried to influence the process.\nDespite the May review, Communications Minister Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri\nawarded the licence to Saudi-backed Cell-C in mid-February, saying she did\nnot have to wait for the review.\nNextCom has said that it still considers the selection procedure faulty and\nis hoping to have Cell-C's win set aside in the review.\n21.      SIEMENS TO SELL GSM HANDSETS IN ARGENTINA\nSiemens is planning to sell GSM handsets this year in Argentina, according\nto reports in the South American press.\nThere are currently some 6.6 million mobile users in Argentina, and Siemens\nwill be up against Nokia, Ericsson, Motorola and Samsung for market share.\nSiemens is hoping to capture a bigger share of the growing Argentine mobile\nmarket that last year generated a volume of nearly $2.9 billion and that,\naccording to forecasts, will exceed fixed-line usage in 2003 with more than\n10 million cellular users.\n22.

TUNISIA NAMES REGULATOR CHIEF DAYS BEFORE AUCTION\nJust days before a deadline to sell a second GSM licence, the Tunisian\ngovernment has appointed Kamel Ayadi, head of the country's engineers\nassociation, as the chairman of a newly created telecoms watchdog.\nUnder new legislation in force since early April, the Telecoms National\nAuthority watchdog was set up to enforce fair competition in the sector,\nincluding on interconnection fees and pricing policy.\nTunisia, which opened a tender for a second GSM licence in March, has set a\nMay 5 deadline for offers.\nThe first mobile licence, awarded in 1996, is held by state-owned Tunisia\nTelecom which has about 150,000 users.\n26.      ISRAEL - 1,000 MORE JOBS TO GO AT ECI TELECOM\nIsraeli telecoms equipment manufacturer ECI Telecom has said that it is to\ncut 1,000 jobs, or about 20 per cent of its workforce, as global telecoms\nslowdown has further hit the struggling company.\nThe company is in the process of a drastic restructuring under which it is\nseeking to spin off five individual units.\nSome observers have suggested that ECI has been in crisis because it tried\nto diversify but was too small to do so effectively. Earlier this year, it\nlaid off 400 employees.\n27.      SLOWING DEMAND FORCES TELEMETRIX PROFIT WARNING\nTelemetrix, the UK's largest semiconductor manufacturer, has issued a profit\nwarning as it suffers slowing demand form telcos.\nTim Curtis, CE, Telemetrix, said that demand from end users for the analogue\nsemiconductors made by the company's Zetex division was expected to be\nweaker for most of this year. As well as mobile makers, power supply\nmanufacturers such as Cisco Systems were also reducing orders.\n Our order book is much shorter than at the year end, or than at this time\nlast year,  Curtis said.\nTelemetrix warned in February that it was starting to feel the effect of\nhigh inventories in the semiconductor market caused by slowing demand for\nelectronic equipment.\nOperating profits at Zetex are expected to be about half last year's GBP13\nmillion. But this will be offset by a better performance at Trend, which\nsupplies network services and broadband test equipment, and which is\nforecast to make operating profits of GBP4 million or more after just GBP1\nmillion for 2000.\n28.      HALF OF MOBILE MAD UK PREPARED TO DUMP HOME PHONE\nMore than half of all UK mobile owners aged between 15 and 34 would rather\nsacrifice their home phone than give up their mobile, according to research\nout this week.\nAcross all age groups, 38 per cent of mobile owners would dump their home\nphone if faced with a choice between the two.\nThe report, by KPMG, revealed that 59 per cent of British adults - around 28\nmillion people - personally owned a mobile in February.\nIt also showed that internet-enabled mobiles have not yet penetrated the\nmarket, claiming that 15 per cent of mobile owners had a phone with internet\nfacilities, rising to over one in five 21 per cent among 15 to 24-year-olds.\nAmong existing ordinary mobile owners, 22 per cent were interested in buying\nan internet-enabled model in the next year, 41 per cent thought it unlikely\nwhile 37 per cent ruled out ever purchasing one.\n37 per cent of users surveyed anticipated using an internet-enabled phone to\nsend messages, followed by finding information from the web (29 per cent)\nand banking (13 per cent).\nJohn Machin of KPMG, said:  The question is not if internet-enabled phones\nwill take off, but when. Our research supports views that the true explosion\nis not likely to happen in the short-term. \n With GPRS and then 3G services on the way, it will happen and service and\ncontent providers need to be preparing in earnest for it now,  Machin said.\n29.      UK OPERATORS TO PAY GBP16B FOR 3G MASTS\nUK mobile operators will have to shell out up to GBP16 billion over the next\neight years to cover the cost of new masts, according to research out this\nweek.\nThe UK will have at least another 10,500 mobile masts by 2010, which will be\nneeded to operate the next generation of mobiles.\nOperators have already paid GBP22 billion for UK 3G licences, but the true\ncost of 3G phones could be as high as GBP50 billion, according to telecoms\nresearch group Northstream Bengt Nordstr\u00f6m.\n30.      IS UK FIXED WIRELESS ECONOMICALLY VIABLE?\nUK communications regulator Oftel has admitted that there may not be an\neconomic case for broadband fixed wireless technology.\nThe British government is planning to resell available broadband fixed\nwireless licences this summer. The plans have been attacked by companies,\nconcerned that the government is setting a reserve price on the spectrum and\nsetting conditions requiring firms to deploy at least 10 per cent of the\nspectrum by June 2002.\nAndrew Somerville, technical director, MLL Telecom, said that it will cost\nabout GBP100,000 to install one broadband fixed wireless base station, plus\nGBP30,000 to connect base stations to each other.\n31.      NO JVS FOR VIMPELCOM AS IT FALLS TO A LOSS\nVimpelcom has announced that it nearly doubled its losses in 2000, reporting\na net loss of $77.8 million after writing off a proportion of its D-AMPS\nnetwork.\nAs it announced the losses, VimpelCom also took the market by surprise by\nfailing to announce any JVs with its regional licences in Russia.\nVimpelcom actually lost $34.6 million, but losses were higher due to the\ndecision to write off a proportion of the companies investment in a D-AMPS\nnetwork.\nThe company said in a statement:  The fast pace of Vimpelcom's GSM network\nexpansion and the faster than anticipated rate of migration of its customers\nfrom the D-AMPS network to the GSM network resulted in impairment of\nVimpelcom's D-AMPS related assets. \n32.      ISRAEL - MIRS LICENCE AWARD FACES FRESH ATTACK\nIsrael's State Comptroller Eliezer Goldberg has attacked the decision by the\nCommunications Ministry to allow MIRS to function as a cellular operator\nwithout a special licence for providing cellular services and without having\nto pay a licence fee.\nMIRS was granted a full cellular licence earlier this year by former\ncommunications minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, and the fee is to be decided\nby an internal assessment to be conducted by the Communications Ministry.\n33.      DIGITAL RUM AND WEBRASKA UNVEIL MCOMMERCE SUITE\nUK technology developer Digital Rum and Webraska have unveiled their new\nrange of mcommerce services with built in location and navigation support.\nWebraska will provide spatial searching, routing, and mapping services via\ntheir personal navigation APIs, which will be integrated into Digital Rum's\ncommerce platform.

PTC RESTRUCTURING DERAILS ELEKTRIM-DT TALKS\nVivendi Universal affiliate Elektrim has said that talks with Deutsche\nTelekom over the sale of its fixed-telephony and datacom operations have\nfailed.\nElektrim and DT signed a LOI late last year regarding the acquisition of\nElektrim's fixed-line and datacom businesses for approximately $180 million.\nThe letter was extended to April 30, after being previously extended from\nFebruary 28 to March 7.\nElektrim spokesman Piotr Czarnawski said no new deadline will be set, adding\nthat the decision not to prolong the validity of the LOI was taken in view\nof the restructuring of Elektrim which is consolidating telecoms assets in\nits mobile telephony unit PTC.\nHowever, Elektrim and DT will continue to discuss other possible\npartnerships or co-operations, he said.\nVivendi Universal owns just over 10 per cent of Elektrim as well as 49 per\ncent of Elektrim Telekomunikacja. ET itself owns 48 pct of Polish mobile\noperator PTC. DT owns 45 per cent of PTC.\n36.      GARTNER SAYS UK OPERATORS OVERESTIMATE SUBS BY 10M\nThere are 10 million less British adults using mobiles than the UK.'s four\nmobile operators claim, according to research published this week.\nHowever, this could be good news for operators, according to the report,\nsince it means there is more scope for subscriber growth than previously\nthought. It also means that ARPU will rise.\nThe report, by Gartner, claims that because of the huge growth in prepaid\nmobiles sold over the past couple of years the mobile operators don't even\nknow who their customers are, let alone exactly how many they have.\nGartner said it commissioned a survey in December of 4,100 people aged 15 or\nover. The survey showed that 63 percent of British adults use mobiles rather\nthan the 86 per cent implied by the four operators.\n In absolute numbers that's 30 million instead of 40 million,  Gartner said.\n37.      25,000 UK USERS TURNED ON BY NAUGHTY MOBILE LOGO\nAn image of a pair of breasts has hit the number one spot for the UK's\nmobile users.\nAccording to iobox, which supplies the image to users, the picture is far\nmore popular than pictures like Chinese symbols.\nSecond most popular is a picture of a reclining nude woman, just ahead of\nthe members of pop band Blur.\nIobox said that it has downloaded more than 25,000 of the breast images in\nthe UK.\nKarin Jonsson\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\nCMS -

These bowls have become remarkably popular amongst the working population in Hyderabad.\nIt works like this:\nEither a group of individuals or the organization, subscribes to the  Prakruti  fruit lunch plan.\nSubscribers to the  Prakruti fruit supplemental lunch Plan  receive the bowls at their workplaces five working days a week and hence for close to 20 working days a month. (Each bowl is priced at an amazing Rs.10/- - amazing because of the quantity that is provided in the bowl. The Minimum number of subscribers per organization is 10.Each bowl of fruit contains more than 200 grams of freshly cut multiple varieties of fruit. And this changes seasonally as well.\n The bottomline is this says  Devaprakash - CEO, FarmConcepts:  Rs. 200/- per month for a product like this is hugely affordable and FarmConcepts takes on the onus of the choice of\nthe best quality, making it convenient for people. And then again, this effort encourages\nthe farming community to provide the best quality and price which\nFarmConcepts passes on to the consumer. FarmConcepts will spearhead efforts in\ndeveloping the market for fresh cut produce in India starting with Hyderabad as\nits launch base.

Unfortunately, due to today's over-processing of foods, we often miss out on the majority of nutrients that nature would otherwise provide. We cannot depend only on our food source for the\nessential antioxidant nutrients needed for vitality, because large-scale methods of food distribution necessitate\nharvesting food before it becomes ripe. As a result, only a negligible amount of crucial vitamins and nutrients\nremains intact. Our modern society makes it nearly impossible to get the cellular protection we need from our diet alone. As a result, supplementation is critical in order to obtain significant vitamin levels in the body. doctors have found after 30 years of research, that the best protection against the premature aging effects\nof free radicals is a combination of natural antioxidant nutrients. Choose a good, natural multi-vitamin supplement that can give you your daily requirements of fruit and vegetable nutrients.

Berkshire said the fund was initially targeted to close at $1.25 billion, but has been oversubscribed and will be capped at $1.5 billion by the end of September or early October.\nThe fund will have the same investment focus as other Berkshire funds, making private equity investments of between $20 million and $200 million in midsize growth companies earning at least $50 million in revenue.\nBerkshire Fund VI will also follow Berkshire's traditional areas of investment in the U.S., Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Berkshire V, an $880-million fund, is 65% committed.\nBerkshire's investments typically take the form of leverage buyouts, recapitalizations, growth capital investments, privatizations, and industry consolidations. The company said it will maintain its focus on the growth manufacturing, business services, transportation/logistics, telecommunications, and retailing industries.\nBerkshire said the limited partners in the fund included previous and new investors, including endowments, foundations, pension funds, and insurance companies. There are 10 partners investing in Berkshire Fund VI.\nhttp://www.berkshirepartners.com\nXtera CEO Bayless Plans Return to Sevin Rosen Full Time\t mail   top\nALLEN, Texas (VENTUREWIRE) -- Sevin Rosen founding partner Jon Bayless, who became acting CEO of optical networking company Xtera Communications last May, said he intends to return to Sevin Rosen on a full-time basis but is committed to remaining at Xtera until it begins generating revenues.\nThat could be a while, as Xtera, based in Allen, Texas, is currently undergoing lab trials and does not expect revenues for another nine months. Xtera raised $110 million in second-round funding in January 2001, but given the downturn in the telecom sector, Mr. Bayless said,  Things are certainly slower than what we originally anticipated. We're not staffed up to where we expected to be, and we're maintaining real tight control on expenses.  The company has 125 employees, but has enacted a hiring freeze.\nOne hire the company doesn't have to worry about, however, is the CEO spot. Xtera's executive vice president and chief operating officer, Carl DeWilde, is being groomed for the CEO role and will take over when Mr. Bayless steps down. Mr. DeWilde joined the company just weeks before Mr. Bayless was named acting CEO, with the understanding that he was a potential CEO candidate, Mr. Bayless said.\nThe company considered opening up a search, but decided to stay with Mr. DeWilde, who previously led product development and strategic planning groups for Fujitsu Network Communications. Prior to those posts, he was director of lightware and multiplex system development at Alcatel.\nMr. Bayless said that pending board approval, he will remain as Xtera's chairman in a role similar to the one he played for publicly traded optical networking company Ciena, exerting a bit more active involvement than is standard for a board position. His tasks at Xtera have been to help move the company from its original headquarters in California, to attract talent, increase revenues, and determine if the company needed an external CEO, he said.\nMr. Bayless said he has not actively sought new investments for about a year, but has continued to look at opportunities coming into Sevin Rosen, and has kept board seats at five other startups: ComSpace, Chiaro Networks, Chorum Technologies, Navarro Networks, and MainControl, a Virginia-based software company. With the exception of MainControl, the other portfolio companies are, like Xtera, based near Dallas.\nAssessing the optics sector, Mr. Bayless predicted that new spending will focus on metropolitan area networks (MANs), but that once bottleneck issues in the MAN are addressed, he sees  the backbone needing to be beefed up again. \nMr. Bayless added that Xtera, which develops long-haul and ultra long-haul products for optical networks, is looking at technology acquisitions, particularly technologies that will not find funding given the current crowding in the optical field.\nIn addition to Sevin Rosen, Xtera is backed by ARCH Venture, Berkeley International, CenterPoint Venture Fund, Communications Ventures, EDF Ventures, Hook Partners, New Enterprise Associates, Rho Ventures, and Star Ventures Management.\nhttp://www.srfunds.com\nhttp://www.xtera.com\nSeeCommerce Founder Starts Enterprise Software Firm\t mail   top\nSAN JOSE, Calif. (VENTUREWIRE) -- Subhash Chowdary, the founder of SeeCommerce, a provider of supply-chain performance managment and improvemet applications, has formed a new company called Aankhen. The company, which is now in stealth mode, is developing enterprise software that will replace existing Internet technology applications for supply chains and electronic commerce, Mr. Chowdary said.\nHe said the software will address supply-chain needs for high-technology and consumer packaged goods companies.\nAankhen has secured a multimillion dollar investment from several undisclosed individual investors, said Mr. Chowdary, and the company expects to raise about $5 million during the early part of next year.\nAankhen, which presently has only four employees, is looking to hire  a few more raw talents,  Mr. Chowdary said.\nMr. Chowdary, a former chief architect at Apple, was most recently president and chief technology officer of Bristlecone, a supply-chain software provider that recently sold its consulting division to IDS Scheer, a publicly traded consulting and software company. Mr. Chowdary said he led the formation of Bristlecone's remaining supply-chain event management software business, which will be named Barometrik.\nhttp://www.aankhen.com\nNanovation Technologies Files for Chapter 11 after Layoffs\t mail   top\nNORTHVILLE, Mich. (VENTUREWIRE) -- Nanovation Technologies, which develops photonic integrated circuits for the telecommunications market, filed for Chapter 11 protection as it restructures, said a company spokesperson. The company laid off two-thirds of its staff last week, after failing to close $75 million in Series C.\nNanovation's investors have invested several million dollars that will carry the company for 100 days, said the spokesperson. A federal court is expected to make a decision on the Chapter 11 filing within 90 days. The company does not expect to make additional layoffs during this time.\nWith $48 million in assets and $28 million in liabilities, Nanovation is considering continuing to raise Series C funding, selling the company, or liquidating assets.\nThe Series C round could not close because Stamford International, which owns 40% of Nanovation, did not authorize the issuing of new shares.\nThe company is backed by more than $91 million from investors including J.P. Morgan Chase, Motorola, Munder NetNet Fund, Palantir, Princeton Capital Fund, Riverside Management Group, and Zweig-DiMenna.\nhttp://www.nanovation.com\nnew money\nColorectal Screening Firm Enterix Gets $7.5-Million Series A\t mail   top\nFALMOUTH, Maine (VENTUREWIRE) -- Enterix, which develops a proprietary screening platform for detecting early warning signs of colorectal cancer, said it has raised $7.5 million in Series A financing from Deutsche Asset Management, Innovation Capital, and Macquarie Technology Fund Management. The funds will be used for research and clinical trials, and for the U.S. launch of the company's colorectal screening service.\nAll participants were new investors in Enterix. Deutsche Asset Management invested slightly over $3 million; Innovation Capital invested $1.85 million; and Macquarie Technology Fund Managment invested $2.6 million. Enterix said it expects the funds to last until 2003.\nThree new directors took seats on the company's board. Gene Lorenz, senior associate director at Deutsche Asset Management; Daniel Phillips, head of Macquarie Technology Investment Banking; and Michael Quinn, executive chairman of Innovation Capital.

Could we make data run faster? Nope done that, could we integrate multiple dial-up accounts including VPN? Nope done that too.\nSo that brought us to the one thing we all do wirelessly and that is email.  How could Snapfire make email faster? Well, we can all agree that sending email using our wireless device can be sluggish. Ever sent attachments with your email, now that is bona fide slow. We got it!\nIntroducing Snapfire MailXpress.\nAt last an uphill compression agent that plugs into Outlook and Exchange systems.\nSo easy it makes wireless email fun again.

We ask for your patience during this time, and encourage you, if you\u2019re not already, to become apart of the family at Snapfire.\nAside from giving you this opportunity to get your advance copy of Snapfire MailXpress at 50% off, we also want to share with you a look ahead to what we are doing and what is around the corner.\n-          Snapfire Client Update.

But a $26-million Series B for InfiniSwitch and $35 million for Graviton in its oversubscribed Series D, led by new investor Merrill Lynch, proved later rounds can still be meaty.\nIn an indication that companies are looking not only for capital but for sage counsel as they navigate the market's choppy seas, four companies added non-VC directors to their boards. One was Talk2 Technology, which appointed former WorldCom executive, Robert B. Hartnett, as its fifth director. In another bid for greater experience, North Bridge Ventures and Matrix Partners switched their board reps for Cereva Networks, naming veteran partners Paul Ferri and Edward Anderson as directors.\nBad news came from Telenisus as it made its second round of layoffs this year, cutting 30 employees, while Clip2 said it is winding down operations and seeking buyers for its assets. In VC fund news, Aurora Funds, which recently closed it Washington, D.C., office, plans to raise its fourth fund, with a target of between $75 million and $100.\n- Lizbeth Scordo\nINTRODUCING\nVentureWire Professional\nVentureWire Professional is available now for an introductory price -- Get more stories, more details, full-text search, and all the competitive information you need to stay ahead, today.

On the bright side,\nretailers could get a boost today after some upbeat news coming\nout of the sector.\nNo. 1 retailer and Dow component Wal-Mart (WMT,49,f2) said sales\nat stores open at least a year rose 7%, above the company's\nprevious guidance of a 4% to 6% rise. Also in retail news,\nconsumer electronic retailer Best Buy (BBY,59,f2) said it\nexpects to surpass 2Q earnings forecasts by $0.08 per share or\nmore, as the company said sales for the quarter rose 31% over\nthe year-ago period to $4.17 billion, with a 2.1% rise in same\nstore sales. Both of these stores may be benefiting from the\nrecent tax rebates.\nShares of American International Group (AIG,74) were lower after\nthe insurance company said it will eliminate 1500 jobs over the\nnext 12 to 18 months due to overlaps created by its recent\nacquisition of American General Corp. AIG also said that it\nplans to buy back up to 10 million shares of its stock.\nShares of supply-chain management software provider Manugistics\nGroup (MANU,10.96,f1) were under pressure in pre-market activity\nafter the company said it now expects to lose $0.14-0.16 per\nshare, excluding charges, for fiscal 2Q due to deteriorating\ndemand for its products. The Street's mean consensus was for a\n$0.03 per share profit. The company also guided 3Q forecasts\nlower.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nTREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY\nBonds, which fell slightly following the release of this\nmorning's weekly jobless claims data, climbed as traders\ndigested the data. Initial jobless claims for the week ended\nSept. 1 fell to 402,000 from the prior week's upwardly revised\n405,000 number. Analysts per Dow Jones Newswires had been\nlooking for initial claims to come in at 400,000. Overall, the\njob market appears to be weakening as the four-week moving\naverage of claims rose to 398,000 and continuing claims for the\nweek ended Aug. 25 continued to swell, rising to 3,207,000, a\nlevel not seen since 1992.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nWORLD MARKETS\nEuropean markets were under water this morning with the\nBloomberg European 500 Index down 1.63% as of 8:50 a.m. EDT.\nTelecoms fell again after Marconi PLC's (MONI,1.14,f1) debt\nrating was cut to junk status by Standard & Poor's. France\nTelecom (FTE,28,f2) added pressure to the sector after saying\nthat it won't be able to eliminate debt as fast as previously\nforecast. The euro was lower against the U.S. dollar as German\nmanufacturing orders for July came in weaker than expected.\nHowever, inflationary pressures appear to be waning as reflected\nby a lower-than-expected euro-zone Producer Price Index report.\nThe bank of England declined to cut interest rates, sending the\nsterling lower against the greenback.\nAsian markets largely declined, but Japan's Nikkei-225 Index\nbucked the trend, closing up 0.49%, despite cautionary remarks\nout of Moody's that the investor services company might cut its\nrating on Japan's government debt as deflationary pressures\nthreaten to accentuate credit risk in the country. The comments\nput pressure on the yen, which had already declined against the\ndollar after yesterday's comments by Treasury Secretary Paul\nO'Neill raised speculation that the U.S. might be willing to\nhelp Japan weaken its currency. Meanwhile, crude oil traded\nhigher after an American Petroleum Institute report last night\nshowed a drawdown in inventories, primarily in heating oil and\ndistillate products.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nFUTURES WATCH\nIn the September Globex futures contract as of 8:50 a.m. EDT,\nthe S&P 500 Index was down 9 points (8 points below fair value),\nwhile the Nasdaq 100 Index was down 22 points (20 points below\nfair value). The September DJIA futures contract was down 57\npoints (53 points below fair value), and the October crude oil\nfutures traded on the NYMEX were up $0.11 at $27.06/barrel.\nWilliam Johnson, Market Analyst\n################################################################\nLog in using the links below to:\nAccess your account:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=CCBodyi&NeedCASelValue=Y\nView your Email Alert customization options:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=EAMyAlerts\nPerform research or request a market quote:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=Quotes\nPlace a trade order:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=TradeStock\nTo visit Schwab's home page, use this link:\nhttp://www.schwab.com/\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nTo unsubscribe or modify your Email Alert customization options,\nlog in using the link below or copy and paste it into your\nbrowser's address window:\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=EAMyAlerts\nNow you can receive graphics Email Alerts in HTML format,\nusing helpful, full-color graphics and active Web links that\nconnect you directly to information you want.

They had me running around here like a chicken with its head cut-off.  Being from Bakersfield, I know that you can relate to that analogy!\nThis week seems to be a little better at work - anyway.  I left my lights on in the Mercedes this morning and when I went out to go to lunch, the thing would not start.  I had to have someone give me a jump and then I was afraid to cut it off.  So, I rode to Stanford shopping center, because I knew that would give the battery enough time to recharge.  It worked and I didn't buy anything - Isn't that great?  Although, I did see a couple of Ties that I need to carry my suits back up there to check on. I carried those suits in my car for a week and finally took them out on Saturday.  I wish that I had them with me today!\nHow was your weekend?  I have this terrible cough that I can't get rid of.  I have had it for about 2 weeks now.  Zack has it as well and he keeps me up at night. He and I were up at about 3:00 am on Sunday morning.  Poor little guy he is such a trooper though.  He never complains, just takes things as they come and trusts that Daddy will fix it.\nI need to get ready for a meeting, but hope that things are going well for you.  I might need to change jobs again.  I am not sure yet, but the boss and I might have different opinions of where to take this organization.  What she wants and what I came here to build might be too far away for a mutual agreement.  I actually got a call from a headhunter looking for a VP of Customer Service.  This position sounded very good and I will know by the end of the week if I should pursue it.\nTalk to you later,\nDouga...", "output": "Ms. Vick - Person Name, Mercedes - Brand Name, Stanford shopping center - Location,  Zack - Person Name, Douga... - Person Name"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "id HCA96LN3; Wed, 10 Apr 2002 17:54:11 -0700\nby mailer.avocadoit.com (8.11.3/8.11.3) with SMTP id g3B0rpv32746\nfor <fernand.braganza@avocadoit.com>; Wed, 10 Apr 2002 17:53:51 -0700\n John P.

At the conference, the company chose to focus on the business advantages of its software rather than the technology itself. CEO Sanjay Kumar highlighted the new business model which allows customers to  try and buy  CA software on a subscription basis.  The theme of CA's flexibility, regarding customer's needs, was central at the conference.\n* Sam Wyly was not at the conference, but his presence and that of the looming proxy fight certainly were felt.  Mr. Kumar challenged the veracity of Mr. Wyly's charges, but after speaking with managers it is clear that the fight is a definite distraction to employees. The CEO spoke in defense of the present CA management and reminded the audience of management's commitment to its employees via the day care center, free breakfast, team spirit, etc.\n* Most of the customers that we met were not enthusiastic about CA's products, but stated that the products did solve about 80% of their problems. Customers also mentioned that they would sacrifice some performance in order to only work with one vendor. Others noted that CA was one of the only companies to support complex and disparate environments.\n* We continue to rate the stock a buy. For further information see the note dated July 10, 2001 (ME)\n------------------------------\nBEA Systems Acquires Group of Developers\n* BEA's (1,4)(BEAS-OTC, $24.56, Buy) acquisition of Crossgain Corporation equates to the hiring of about 20 software developers. The new hires will work primarily with the E-Commerce Server Division and focus on tools for the software that this division generates. BEA was careful to note that the company  intends to continue to support an open tools strategy, partnering with a broad range of independent tools vendors to provide customers with the maximum choice and flexibility in building e-business applications.  We believe BEA's continued success is partially dependent on its ability to foster partnerships with ISVs, while slowly infringing on their domain of expertise as they expand the sphere of influence of the application server. (JD)\n------------------------------\nConcur Adds 80+ New ASP Clients During The Past Three Months\n* Concur Technologies, Inc. (CNQR-OTC, $1.56, not rated), a provider of expense management solutions has won more than 80 new ASP clients in the last three months. New clients include Baltimore Ravens Limited Partnership, the Bradford Company, Interface, Inc., Krones, Inc., and Premier. Clients sited the following reasons for adopting the company's ASP solutions: minimal total cost of ownership with little upfront investment and IT staff support requirements, rapid implementation and return on investment, universal Web-access, and its ability to integrate with existing credit card programs and accounting software. (RM)\n------------------------------\n It's Deja Vu all over again  - Neon Systems joined the long list of integration software vendors to pre-announce 1Q01 financial results; Also appoints new CFO\n* After the close on July 9, Neon Systems (3)(NESY-OTC, $6.20, not rated) became the latest casualty in the integration software space, joining Vitria (VITR-OTC,$4.23, not rated), Excelon (EXLN-OTC, $1.25, not rated), Talarian (TALR-OTC, $1.50, Buy), Seebeyond (1)(SBYN-OTC, $10.10, Buy), and webMethods (1)(WEBM-OTC, $19.25, Buy) in pre-announcing disappointing earnings.  For the June quarter, the company expects to report total revenue in the range of $6.0 million to $6.2 million and a net operating loss in the range of $0.24 and $0.27, which compares with first call consensus estimates of a $0.08 loss.  Management blames the miss on a shortfall on license revenue from its mainframe product and declining international revenues due to the weak economic backdrop.  The company also announced that it appointed Brad Poyner as Chief Financial Officer, filling a void after the departure of Steve Odom, who stepped down as president, CFO and COO in June. (JD)\n------------------------------\nARTG to also support BEA application server, in addition to HP and iPlanet\n* Art Technology Group (ARTG-OTC, $3.49, not rated) announced that it plans to support BEA WebLogic application server, in addition to supporting Hewlett Packard Bluestone (HP-HYSE, $30.20, Buy), and iPlanet as announced during their conference call last week. ARTG hopes to broaden the market opportunity for its e-commerce, personalization application, Dynamo, by leveraging customers' preference to write and run e-applications on third-party application servers. The company expects to release Dynamo with third-party application server support by 4Q 2001. ARTG will continue to develop, market, and support its proprietary application server. We view this announcement as further validation of the application server as the development platform on which the next generation of Web-based applications will be built. We continue to believe that the application server market is a two-horse race between BEA (1,4)(BEAS-OTC, $24.56, Buy) and IBM (IBM-NYSE, $101.76, suspended). (JD)\n------------------------------\nBusiness Objects Names John Olsen President and Chief Operating Officer.\n* Business Objects (1)(BOBJ, NASD- $20.72, Hold) announced today that it has named current board director, John Olsen, to the post of president and chief operating officer. Olsen was appointed to the board of directors of Business Objects in October 2000 and will still sit on the board. Mr. Olsen has worked in the software and services industries for 25 years.\n* We applaud Business Objects appointment of Mr. Olsen. We remain firmly the investing sidelines and maintain our hold rating.

By comparison, only 39 percent of investors polled believed that a war with Iraq would have a more negative effect on the market.\nIt\u2019s an interesting data point. One that adds to the argument that, unless integrity is restored to all corners of the investing landscape, investors will continue to hoard cash rather than again risk it in a market with those who seem incapable of telling the truth.  This is as true for corporate executives who schemed millions of dollars into their own pockets as it is for Wall Street analysts who pretended to be bullish on stocks only to reap millions in investment banking fees for their own firms.\nThe tables have apparently already turned.  Wall Street layoffs, high profile guilty pleas, and steep market declines have caused those same Wall Street firms as much pain as they themselves inflicted.  But it has also yielded a new emphasis, and perhaps even a new industry, based on fundamentally independent investment research and analysis; analysis which investors can trust to value stocks more accurately and objectively.\nAs Wall Street\u2019s investment banks promise to splinter off their research arms into fully independent units \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s too many forces at work for them to ever be fully independent,\u201d says one banker \u2013 new valuation methodologies put out by firms like New York-based Vista Research, management consultant McKinsey & Company, as well as various other newsletters and independent analysts, now offer interesting stock picking alternatives.\nGrowth Report is an independent investment newsletter offing individual investors unbiased research information on numerous publicly held companies.  We hope you will consider signup up for a PREMIUM Growth Report subscription at http://www.growthreport.com/register.asp to stay abreast of the latest research from the Growth Report Newsletter.\nGoing independent ...\nThere are two advantages to paying closer attention to independent research.\nFirst, the Buy, Sell, and Hold recommendations out of sell side analysts are simply tainted.  Although not all analysts created false recommendations to prop up stocks that should have been more appropriately valued at zero, enough of them performed such magic as to make the entire process suspect.  Independent research firms don\u2019t have such investment banking conflicts.\nSecond, the methodologies used to value stocks during the stock market bubble relied on certain assumption, and perhaps even certain numbers, which allowed analysts to inflate their forecasts and expectations while avoiding an accurate picture of a company\u2019s true financial health.  As Vista Research Senior Analyst David Trainer explains, \u201cThe accounting rules that govern financial reporting were never designed for equity investors and are more suited for credit analysis and accountants.  For example, the cost of annual Employee Stock Option (ESOs) issuances is higher than 100 percent of revenues for some companies and a significant operating expense for others. What\u2019s more, the liability related to outstanding ESOs claims as much as 5-10 percent of the market value of the companies we\u2019ve analyzed. Equity analysts need to account for this.\u201d\nBy looking at financial information disclosed within 10-Q and 10-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, firms like Vista are able to translate accounting statements into economic analyses that potentially reveal a more reliable picture of business profitability and true company cash flow.  In fact, as both McKinsey and Vista emphasize, the valuation levels of stocks is, was, and always will be based on cash flow \u2013 something few highflying firms could point to during the bubble.  Shortcut snapshots such as price-to-earnings, price-to-sales, and EBITDA (earnings before income, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) are tools to help in predicting stock prices and valuations; but they were never meant to be, themselves, the sole basis for stock price analysis.\nWithout getting too technical, Vista\u2019s Trainer says the true profitability of a business can be derived from the calculation of three key values: a) NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Tax): The after-tax operating cash generated by the business; b) Invested Capital: The sum of all cash that has been invested in a company's net assets over its life; and c) the WACC (Weighted-Average Cost of Capital) which is the average of debt and equity capital costs that all publicly traded companies with debt and equity stakeholders incur as a cost of operating.\nKnowing these three fundamental drivers \u2013 NOPAT, Invested Capital, and WACC \u2013 allows analysts like Trainer to derive a more fundamental picture of a company\u2019s profitability.  Specifically, free cash flow, return on invested capital, risk-adjusted returns on capital and economic profit can now be calculated and quantified and, as a result, recommendations can be made as to whether stock prices and market valuations appear justified within current market conditions and under basic assumptions of company growth rates.\nProving the model...\nIt\u2019s a retro level of analysis better understood in practice \u2013 hindsight being the 20/20 vision that it is.\nAccording to Vista\u2019s model, previous technology high-flyers such as WorldCom ( Nasdaq: WCOM), Verisign ( Nasdaq: VRSN), Intel ( Nasdaq: INTC) and Oracle ( Nasdaq: ORCL) never had any business being anywhere near their previous stock prices.  For example, according to Vista\u2019s research, to justify a $20 stock price, WorldCom would have had to increase its revenues 15 percent annually for the next 20 years while quadrupling its returns on invested capital. Moreover, by digging deep within WorldCom\u2019s filings, a large discrepancy can now be seen between reported earnings and free cash flows beginning in 1994 and reaching nearly $65 billion in 1998.\nLikewise, even at depressed price levels, Internet security firm Versign still faces hurdles when justifying its current stock price. To be appropriately valued near $6, according to Vista, the company must increase revenues by 16 percent annually for the next 21 years while increasing its return on invested capital five-fold.\nAnd when it comes to Intel, \u201cmarket expectations imply that Intel must maintain both its revenue growth and profitability for as many as 13 years [to justify current stock price and analyst forecasts.]  Investors need to have confidence in the company's ability to dominate the cyclical semiconductor market for quite a long time to warrant buying shares at recent price levels,\u201d says a recent Vista report.\nSo what\u2019s the good news?  Trainer says look at Symantec ( Nasdaq: SYMC) for growth, great cash flow and good numbers to justify its valuation.  The message being that it\u2019s the numbers, not whether it\u2019s tech or some other sector, which will always bear out appropriate valuation levels.\nTime will tell whether the new models of discounted cash flow analysis make better sense than the unjustified analyses that were offered to investors during the previous bull market.  However, at least independent research outfits are finally learning to return to the fundamentals treasured by no less than Warren Buffett and famed finance Professors Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani.  The old adage still stands: \u201cThe value of any asset equals the discounted present value of its cash flows.\u201d  How could we have forgotten?\nSubscribe Today!\nAre you looking for an independent source of investment research?

Another straw argument.\nYou will search in vain for such a statement from me.  Many are violent\nmurderers, most are passive and apathetic, a few are trying to do the right\nthing.  Kind of like the bell curve found in most other demographic groups.\n If I wanted to write a big discourse about polygamy, blacks and the\npriesthood, Danites, and the Mountain Meadows Massacre, I could paint a\npretty ugly picture of the LDS Church, but that doesn't mean that all\nLatter-Day Saints are violent murderers.   Oh, I disagree.  I don't know\nabout the Danite point at all, but the others have perfectly respectable and\nplausible explanations that the Church has nothing to apologize for (a long\nand separate discussion).  I'm sorry you are ashamed of your faith.\n If you read any interviews with Osama bin Laden, he is constantly labeling\nall Americans as greedy, unbelieving, exploiting the Arab world, etc.   Yes,\nhe along with most of the leading Muslim politicians, clerics, and\nintellectuals.\n Indonesia.  Malaysia.  Pakistan.  Do you want me to keep going?   Yes,\nplease keep going . . . And by the way, I do not characterize those\ncountries as open to missionary work in the traditional sense, and we\ncertainly cannot build normal churches or temples there.  We have\nhumanitarian missionaries even in China.  But, I have confidence that God\nloves those peoples and is working to open them up like He did Japan, the\nUSSR, etc., in spite of Islam and not because of it.\n Whoa!  Just because they belong to a specific racial or religious group\nthey have a special responsibility to target these extremists?   I'm saying\nthat if you have physical, intellectual or linguistic characteristics that\nare of unique value against an enemy, you have a duty to step forward for\nAmerica.  Japanese- and Native- Americans, Italian-Americans, and\nGerman-Americans did in fact do that during WWII.  Our military does not\nhave a single person who speaks the same language as the Taliban, and\nobviously an enemy that uses ethnicity as a weapon cannot be infiltrated by\nsomeone who is Japanese or Swedish.\n Mr. Abdul, what are you doing to stop the Mormon fundamentalists in Manti\nthat claim that God told them that they can sleep with a bunch of\n14-year-old girls?   Passive sexual behavior, which is in general a private\nmatter government should leave alone, is quite different than violent\nbehavior against general society.  If Mormon fundamentalist start dousing\n6,000 people in San Francisco with burning jet fuel, then yes, I'll be\ncontacting the FBI to lend my knowledge of Southern Utah topography and will\nvolunteer to fight.  So, even assuming that Mormon fundamentalists should be\ntreated like criminals, their activity does not demand an affirmative\ncampaign of vigilance to preserve the foundations of society against iminent\ndestruction.\n Well, as I've said on this list before, the Arab world has plenty of\nreasons to hate us.   Oh, just about everyone has some reason to hate\nsomeone else--the question is whether one acts upon it.  Muslims have been\ninvolved in just as much slavery, rape, plunder, exploitation, etc., as\nanyone else in the world, and they really need to acknowledge that fact and\nfollow Christians and Hindus on the path out of the Dark Ages.  Most of\nthese countries could start by allowing their own people to vote.\n The Palestinians have had to deal with all kinds of discrimination and\nheartless treatment by the Israelis, and Israel is the single largest\nrecipient of U.S. foreign aid.   Perspective tends to change when you're a\ntarget instead of a pontificating bystander.  Perhaps you will be able to\nempathize with Israeli security a bit more after more incidents really\nchange our way of life.  Opinions go into flux when they are collecting your\nfriend's teeth off the sidewalk instead of someone else's.\n And once again, you can't label millions of people as violent extremists\nbased on the actions of a small few.   Oh, I didn't.  I said many of them,\nthough not all, were passive sympathizers in the face of evil.  And, I don't\nlabel anyone as a follower of racist diatribe--that is what Muslims do to\nthemselves by professing allegiance to the Koran.  You still haven't\nprovided an innocent explanation for what the Koran says--I'm always open to\nhearing it!\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\nThis message was posted through the lds-chat@lists.stanford.edu email list.\nTo unsubscribe, email majordomo@lists.stanford.edu with the message\n unsubscribe lds-chat .

So, ...\n-  Beth Osborne Daponte, a worker at the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that\n40,000 women and 32,000 children in Iraq died in the Gulf War.  Today,\nUNICEF estimates that 5000-6000 Iraqi children die each month from\nstarvation and malnutrition as a result of American sanctions. \nIt amazes me that with technology today we simply pass off a statement from someone as actual facts by simply giving a name and attaching where they work:  In reality, the US Census Bureau has never estimated any civilian casualties outside of a few hundred.  Even Iraq itself claimed very few casualties.  I doubt if 5,000 children die each month.  That means over 600,000 children have died in the last 10 years.  I would be surprised if that number is close to their birth rate.  The sanctions are sponsored by the United Nations, not just the US alone.  Iraq has used the money raised from selling oil to strip money out of its citizens and pumped it into the development of mass destruction weapons.  So while there is a measurable impact on Iraqi citizens due to the UN sanctions, one could easily argue they are no less than the initial negative impacts from the government's campaign of sucking its own economy dry for military reasons.\n-  For years, the United States propped up the government of the Shah in\nIran since he opposed the Soviet Union.  They did this in spite of the fact\nthat he was a ruthless tyrant who was universally hated by his people.  It\nwas easy for the revolutionaries to label the U.S. as the  Great Satan  as\nhe was toppled from power. \nWhat does this even mean?  Propped up?  Does this mean we deserve to be attacked by terrorists because we supported a leader that some of his people hated?\n-  To this day, hundreds of Palestinians die from attacks by Isrealis, using\nweapons that were supplied by the United States.  The entire region lives\nin fear of Israel's nuclear arsenal that was basically supplied by the\nUnited States. \nThe number of Palestinian attacks against Israel outnumber Israel's by 3 to 1.  Israel is surrounded by dozens of anti-Israel countries.  If not for the United States' support, an entire people and culture (Israel) would have been removed from the earth years ago.  Israel typically follows the same military program as the United States - only retaliate when attacked first.  Why would little old Israel try to start trouble with dozens of other countries that it knows it cannot outnumber?  While certainly not the patron saints of the world, they have been the #1 location of terrorist attacks for many decades.\n If we attack Afghanistan, all we'll do is kill thousands of innocent people\nand give the Arab world one more reason to hate the United States.  Even if\nwe managed to take out bin Laden by some miracle, as long as they hate the\nWest, there will be someone willing to kill innocent American\ncitizens.  The only way we can eliminate terrorism is to eliminate the root\ncauses of terrorism: this hatred of the United States. \nJust as with Iraq, we will not go in and bomb Afghanistan.  Our leaders are very well aware of the fact that it is not a nation attacking us but rather one extreme, fanatical group or groups.   We will have specific campaigns only against terrorist camps and logistics locations.  And let's not forget that once again, its not just the United States - this will be an international force.  I would be interested to hear if the United States is at fault, why are nearly 50 countries ready to join in support to rid the world of these terrorists?  Our intent, nor never will be, to simply to kill thousands of innocent people as a form of retaliation.\nI am of the opinion that the Arab nations have been looking for guidance and support to rid themselves of these fanatics and now they have it.  We understand that the Saudis have basically been told to make sure nothing happens to the oil fields and that a free-flowing supply remains available to us.  The same thing to the other Gulf States--they understand what is being said and have assured us that OPEC will take care of it.\nThis is not the time for  sunshine patriots  but for people who love America and will support her through thick and thin.  The times have changed: the USA has been attacked on our own soil.  This is an act of war.  When Admiral Yamamoto was asked after the Pearl Harbor attack what he thought, he responded:  I fear we have awakened a sleeping tiger.    Our nation for many years has acted like a  paper tiger  but now we have been awakened like NO one under thet age of 60 remembers.\nI am thankful and grateful for being an American citizen.  At an early age I was able to see the difference of countries with and without freedom (ie, East and West Germany, Berlin).  I have walked on the ground of Dachau and felt the spirit of those that died by the hand of evil men.  I worry about the hatred and prejudice now brought to birth in our own nation to those that have to come America for a better life, chance for freedom and to add to what makes this nation great.  Much was lost last week, not just lives.  As Francis Scott Key so eloquently said,  then conquer we must, when our cause it is just.   So with having said more than enough... I close.\nElisabeth Whaley", "output": "Beth Osborne Daponte - Person Name, U.S. Census Bureau - Organizations, Iraq - Location, UNICEF - Organizations, United Nations - Organizations, US - Location, Iraq - Location, United States  - Location, Iran - Location, Soviet Union - Location, Israel's  - Location, United States.\" - Location, Afghanistan - Location, Arab world - Location, United States - Location,  bin Laden - Person Name, West - Location, United States - Location,  Iraq - Location, Afghanistan - Location, United States - Location, United States - Location, Admiral Yamamoto - Person Name, Pearl Harbor - Location, East and West Germany, Berlin - Location, Dachau  - Location, America - Location, Francis Scott Key - Person Name, Elisabeth Whaley - Person Name"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "id K6V2S692; Tue, 15 May 2001 17:15:19 -0700\nby mailer.avocadoit.com (8.11.3/8.11.3) with SMTP id f4G05Yr13979\nfor <jagarwal@avocadoit.com>; Tue, 15 May 2001 17:05:35 -0700\nMessage-Id: <200105160005.f4G05Yr13979@mailer.avocadoit.com>\nHello jagrati,\nThis week you can double your internet connection speed for FREE and have a chance to Win a BMW Z3 or $30,000 CASH at the same time!

If stocks won\u2019t go up, there must at least be some that won\u2019t go down.\nThis week I bought stock in Bristol-Myers Squibb ( NYSE: BMY).  I figured I\u2019d better put my money where my mouth was, as my mouth had grown larger with each column written about it.  I bought the standard 100 shares and stuck them in my Roth IRA.\nOf course, the market took a dive and I was already down a point.  That was fine.  The chart looked as if there was a bottom forming in the beleaguered pharmaceutical company\u2019s stock and I\u2019ll hold it for the long haul regardless.\nThe experience made me realize, however, that while we all search for stocks ready to go higher \u2013 the growth stocks of tomorrow -- what we secretly also want are stocks that at least won\u2019t go down.  Threats of war, corporate corruption, an economy sometimes teetering on recession (sometimes not) will do that to you.  We\u2019re spooked.  Whether or not we will bomb Iraq only makes it worse.\nEven if we\u2019re convinced certain stocks are ridiculously cheap, we want better than that.  We want them to be bomb proof.\nProtecting your assets\nHistorically, there must be lists and lists of companies whose businesses soar during times of war.  The defense contractors are one obvious choice.  I\u2019d stick with the drug companies as another.  With a Middle East conflict you can bet energy prices would spike so I don\u2019t think big oil is going to suffer.  Even Starbucks ( Nasdaq: SBUX) or Peet\u2019s Coffee ( Nasdaq: PEET) \u2013 people can\u2019t live without their lattes -- might be good picks.\nYet, I break down \u201cbomb proof\u201d stocks a bit differently.  They\u2019ve either got to be companies like Bristol-Myers, already so shell-shocked from poor business decisions and lousy market conditions that a bad hair day for Saddam Hussein won\u2019t matter a bit.  Or they\u2019ve got to be companies either so insulated from world events, or so necessary to our own daily lives, that barring an entire shift of the world\u2019s oceans these businesses will continue blindly on.\nIf BMY satisfies the first scenario, then I\u2019d offer two companies that might satisfy the second.  The first company is one mentioned here before and one soon to be featured in the Growth Report: Speedway Motorsports Inc. ( NYSE: TRK).  In order to receive this report on Speedway to be released this week, you must subscribe to the PREMIUM Growth Report Newsletter.  Sign-up for a risk-free trial to Growth Report at http://www.growthreport.com/register.asp.  With its 700,000 spectator seats spread across six motor speedways in the US, TRK has a very nice niche business that continues to grow steadily; seemingly insulated from foreign policy upheavals.\nSpeedway was the first motor sports company to be publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange and is the kind of niche business that can show terrific revenue growth and stunning earnings power even when CNN is all doom and gloom.  In its most recent quarter ending March 31, 2002, Speedway reported that total revenue increased 45 percent or $29.8 million to $96.6 million from a year ago. Income from continuing operations (before the cumulative effect of an accounting change in 2002) increased 178 percent or $11.1 million to $17.4 million.\nAlthough recreation-based businesses tend to slump when the economy heads south or people feel the need to conserve their cash, car racing has pulled ahead as one of the fastest growing sports in the country catering to an intensely loyal subgroup of fans.  Even in times of foreign conflict people need a diversion; my hunch is car racing is as good as any.\nThe other stock is Automatic Data Processing ( NYSE: ADP) a $22 billion giant that provides all sorts of transaction processing, from payroll processing to retirement plan services to brokerage trade processing. With much cash and no debt, ADP uses technology to make various and generally mundane operations \u2013 like processing insurance claims -- more efficient. Not only is the company profitable, basically it\u2019s a cash cow.\nAlthough recent fiscal fourth-quarter results fell short of expectations -- concluding an impressive 41-year history of double-digit growth in earnings per share \u2013 the stock has already taken a hit and bounced back and profits aren\u2019t going to simply disappear.  Perhaps ADP does not fit the profile of a growth stock as we know it, yet good times and bad the paperwork of our lives will need to be processed; and ADP will be there to satisfy that demand.\nClearly, upside within any stock \u2013 growth or defensive -- may be capped by the future magnitude of investor unease or international uncertainty.  Yet, there may indeed be patriotic ways of playing the markets and riding out any desert storm while at the same time cherry-picking some incredibly cheap stocks along the way.\nSubscribe NOW...\nIn order to stay abreast of all Portfolio changes and alerts, new stock and sector picks, and to receive the Print Version of Growth Report, please register for a FREE trial to the PREMIUM Growth Report Newsletter by following this link:    http://www.growthreport.com/register.asp\nHappy Investing,\nPeter Henig\nContributing Editor\nGrowth Report\nWe appreciate your feedback!

I worked closedly with them when I was at HP.  However, we need to have an internal understanding that we are in the exploratory mode at this time.  While VV was used at Security First, I am unaware of any other institutions that have fully used it's capabilities.  VV requires very specialized knowledge to implement.  There are other products from the VV family that we may be able to leverage however.  We can explore all this at the HP meeting.\nRegards,\nAlex\nRobert Moore <rmoore@avocadoit.com> wrote:\nGlenn and Alex,\nVirtualVault is dominant in the financial services market and is a key\nproduct for HP.

Without that they really have few solid customers and partners.  Let's take a closer look at these claims.\nFirst off, their burn rate.  They now claim to have over 300 employees. While I don't know what their burn rate is at the moment, looking at their S1 filed last Sept when they only had 176 employees provides some pretty shocking details:  At time of filing, burn was $7.4M in Sept alone, and a total of $39M in 6 months ($28M for ops, rest in investments/acquisitions). If you assume they could hold it to $7M despite growing headcount almost 70% they'd have burned another $50M since the filing and should run out by mid 2002. If it grew only 35% to $10M then expect them to be out of cash this coming Spring.\nOf course, this actually assumes they hit the necessary milestones as set out by the VCs!\nWhich brings us to the second major issue: their funding level. The $200M in the bank claim  is a fallacy.  Brience has to go to the well every month to get money.  The VCs must approve every month's capital outlay - and they could refuse at any time.  The VCs who originally signed up, lead by GTCR, never expected to have to invest the full $200M - once they IPOed, they'd be getting public  venture financing  (they disclose as much in S1).\nGiven the tight funding climate today, its no surprise analysts like  Seamus McAteer from Jupiter thinks they are going to go out of business.\nAmitabh also mentioned that many of the competitors that are coming to us and asking us to acquire them also went to Brience and found out that Brience is more of a SI than a product company (their thick client app for Ingram Micro is a good example).  These companies immediately turned away because they want to be a part of a product company.\nTo wit, Sales Team, if you're asked about Brience:\n1.  They are unstable with funding and there is a good chance that they will not be around much longer.  The $200M credit line hurts them because the well can be cut off at any time they're burning cash like its going out of style, the VCs put money in expecting a quick (that's not marketing spin -the language of agreement says they'd stop funding at IPO and of course they tried to flip within 6 months of start) and to date there is very little to show for it.\n2.  They are a professional services company, not a product company.\n3.  They do not have any signficant traction with customers or partners.\nRon", "output": "Brience - Organizations, GTCR - Person Name, Seamus McAteer - Person Name, Jupiter - Location, Amitabh - Person Name, Brience - Organizations, Brience - Organizations, Brience - Organizations"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "id P9T6J16H; Tue, 25 Sep 2001 03:19:32 -0700\nby mailer.avocadoit.com (8.11.3/8.11.3) with SMTP id f8P9lxn19417\nfor <Elisabeth.Whaley@avocadoit.com>; Tue, 25 Sep 2001 02:47:59 -0700\nby lists.Stanford.EDU (8.11.3/8.11.3) id f8P9x1007304\nfor lds-chat-out271187; Tue, 25 Sep 2001 02:59:01 -0700 (PDT)\nby lists.Stanford.EDU (8.11.3/8.11.3) with ESMTP id f8P9x0l07299\nfor <lds-chat@lists.stanford.edu>; Tue, 25 Sep 2001 02:59:00 -0700 (PDT)\nby mclean.mail.mindspring.net (8.9.3/8.8.5) with ESMTP id FAA05453\nfor <lds-chat@lists.stanford.edu>; Tue, 25 Sep 2001 05:58:58 -0400 (EDT)\nMessage-Id: <5.1.0.14.2.20010925025827.022c84b0@ebair.pobox.stanford.edu>\nX-Sender: ebair@ebair.pobox.stanford.edu (Unverified)\nMime-Version: 1.0\nPrecedence: bulk\nThis is an e-mail I received from a Romanian student in my department.\nEric\n>Date: Tue, 25 Sep 2001 00:07:52 -0700\n>From: Bogdan Popescu <bogdan@stat.Stanford.EDU>\n>To: <all@stat.Stanford.EDU>\n>Subject:  Only freedom can work such miracles \n>\n>\n>Hello,\n>\n>I included in the body of this email an Editorial of the most influential\n>Romanian newspaper.

Some of them are nearly extinct,\n>others are incompatible with one another, and in matters of religious\n>beliefs, not even God can count how many they are.\n>Still, the American  tragedy turned three hundred million people into a\n>hand put on the heart. Nobody rushed to accuse the White House, the\n>army, the secret services that they are only a bunch of losers. Nobody\n>rushed to empty their bank accounts. Nobody rushed on the streets nearby\n>to gape about. The Americans volunteered to donate blood and to give a\n>helping hand. After the first moments of panic, they raised the flag on\n>the smoking ruins, putting on T-shirts, caps and ties in the colours of\n>the national flag. They placed flags on buildings and cars as if in\n>every place and on every car a minister or the president was passing. On\n>every occasion they started singing their traditional song:  God Bless\n>America! .\n>Silent as a rock, I watched the charity concert broadcast on Saturday\n>once, twice, three times, on different tv channels.

It made you\n>green with envy because you weren't able to sing for your country without\n>running the risk of being considered chauvinist, ridiculous,\n>or suspected of who-knows-what mean interests. I watched the live\n>broadcast and the rerun of its rerun for hours listening to the story of\n>the guy who went down one hundred floors with a woman in a wheelchair\n>without knowing who she was, or of the Californian hockey player, who\n>fought with the terrorists and prevented the plane from hitting a target\n>that would have killed other hundreds or thousands of people. How\n>on earth were they able to bow before a fellow human?\n>Imperceptibly, with every word and musical note, the memory of some turned\n>into a modern myth of tragic heroes. And with every phone call, millions\n>and millions of dollars were put in a collection aimed at\n>rewarding not a man or a family, but a spirit which\n>nothing can buy.\n>\n>What on earth can unite the Americans in such a way? Their land? Their\n>galloping history? Their economic power? Money? I tried for hours to find\n>an answer, humming songs and murmuring phrases which risk of sounding like\n>commonplaces.

FlashPoint's Photivity\u2122 end-to-end digital imaging platform will provide a solution for business customers to send images from the point of capture to the Internet, using a digital camera connected to a Sprint PCS Internet-ready Phone.\nPhotivity is a powerful, flexible platform that provides the underlying technology for the future of digital imaging. It allows partners and developers to create customized business and consumer applications designed to specifically meet their end customers' needs. Integrating this platform with the Sprint PCS network makes it possible for business customers to transmit images, along with embedded information about the image, from remote locations to colleagues and corporate enterprises anywhere in the world. Images can be sent directly from a digital camera to a Sprint PCS hosted Web account where the photos can be stored, viewed and manipulated. It also allows customers to send e-mail directly from the camera so that colleagues and clients can be invited to view, make comments, evaluate and approve images on the hosted site, creating a dynamically shared photo album that bolsters and enhances workflow.\n Sprint PCS continues to strengthen its leadership position by launching cutting-edge, data-enabled wireless applications aimed at helping our enterprise customers be more productive, reduce costs and provide better customer service,  said Jay Highley, vice president, business marketing.  Using FlashPoint's Photivity platform, we will be able to offer an innovative and relevant wireless imaging solution to business customers across a broad range of industries. Being able to send pictures to the Web from remote locations in real-time via the Sprint PCS all-digital nationwide network will be a valuable productivity tool that translates into a competitive advantage for businesses with a highly mobile workforce. \nWireless imaging has broad appeal with potential applications in several industries including real estate, insurance, construction, architectural, engineering, law enforcement and media. For example, an insurance claims adjuster could visit a home damaged by a tornado and file the images on the spot by taking photos on a digital camera, connecting their camera to a Sprint PCS Internet-ready Phone, and sending the images to the insurance company's Sprint PCS-hosted Web site. The onsite process will reduce the time necessary to process claims, leading to enhanced productivity and customer satisfaction. Or a real estate agent could capture images of listed homes, attach descriptions and quickly publish them for potential buyers to inspect online without going back to their office. The real-time nature of this service ultimately saves the agent time, money and could mean higher sales.\n Sprint PCS is an ideal partner for FlashPoint's Photivity platform,  said FlashPoint President Stephen Saylor.

With August out of the way and the traders coming back from the Hamptons to do some work, hopefully we\u2019ll see some action in this market.  It certainly has not been an easy summer, with indices such as the Dow falling from 10,000 to the 8,300-level.\nThat said, we are pleased to see some glimmers of hope in the Growth Report Portfolio.  We continue to examine growth opportunities despite market conditions, and next week will be delivering a report on Speedway Motorsports ( NYSE: TRK), a leading owner and operator of motor-racing facilities in the U.S., and host to numerous racing events including NASCAR.

Growth Report views this as a strong indication from consumers that there is a real need for affordable and reliable DVD creation software, such as that provided by Sonic.\n Adaptec chose Sonic as a strategic partner based on its clear leadership in the professional DVD industry and because its software makes it fast and easy for consumers to capture and edit video and create professional quality DVDs, right on their desktop,\u201d said Jeff Loebbaka of Adaptec.\nShares of Sonic Solutions remain healthy, trading in the $8 to $9 range on healthy volume of several hundred shares per day.  Strong institutional coverage has clearly assisted in supporting shares, and events at Adams, Harkness, & Hill and SG Cowen are sure to create additional coverage for the DVD authoring company with a $131 million market capitalization.\nCome on, JCOM\u2026 Growth Report Locks In Gains of 54%\u2026\nPerhaps what j2 Communications ( Nasdaq: JCOM) really needs is a fax-to-email service to notify investors of its plunging stock price.  Shares of JCOM were hammered last week, with the stock closing down some 21.5% in one trading session.\nWe\u2019ve had a great run with JCOM since we added to the Growth Report Portfolio on April 29 at $10.86.  Our initial target price of $15 - $16 per share was met, and following Q2 earnings, we revised our share price estimate upward to $25 - $27 based on a PE of 23 \u2013 25.\nFollowing our revision, shares of JCOM jumped, coming within pennies of our 12-month revised stock price projection.  However, the recent pullback in shares of JCOM has caused some concern.  With the recent fall in share price, Growth Report is issuing a sell notice on shares of JCOM at $16.76 on September 5, 2002.  This represents locking in a gain of 54% for Growth Report subscribers in some 5 months \u2013 not bad when you consider the direction of the general market during this period!\nWe will continue to watch shares of JCOM and look for a re-entry point.  We still believe the company is capable of delivering on fiscal year 2002 earnings, but remain cautious regarding the stock in the short term.\nAirlines Hit Turbulence?\nWhile JetBlue Airways ( Nasdaq: JBLU) continues to show growth in air traffic, the stock continues in a downward tailspin.  The overall industry has gotten a good kick in the butt with the pending bankruptcy announcement from United Airlines (NYSE: UAL).  August traffic numbers showed an increase of 104% on a capacity increase of 95%.  Load factor for August was 90.5%, four points above August 2001.\nThe death of UAL would not be great for the industry as a whole, but we certainly believe it will clear the way for effective and profitable airlines such as JetBlue and Southwest to enter additional markets, and for new airline companies to figure out how to actually run a real business.\nAdditionally, we will continue to watch shares of the discount airliner as dooms-day approaches.  In the August 2, 2002 Growth Report Portfolio Update, we mentioned that on October 4, a boatload of insider and VC shares from the financing will become \u201cfree trading.\u201d  We\u2019re hoping the insiders will figure out a reasonable manner in which to \u201cdump\u201d their holdings but aren\u2019t willing to bet on it.  With early stage investors acquiring shares at $5.27 back in 1998, you had better believe they will want to get some of that money off the table when they\u2019re looking at 600% gain.\nGrowth Report continues to believe in JetBlue as a strong growth stock, and we will watch the trading of shares in the coming months looking for any larger than usual selling from insiders.\nWendy\u2019s Growth In-line With Expectation\u2026\nShares of Growth Report\u2019s favorite fast-food chain, Wendy's ( NYSE: WEN) have stabilized somewhat in the mid-30s for the time being, after falling from a run to the low-40s in June.\nYesterday the company announced that it is on track to meet earlier earnings projections of $1.90 - $1.95 per share for 2002.  The earnings projections are in line with Wall Street\u2019s consensus estimates of $1.93 for fiscal year 2002 according to Thompson First Call.  If met, 2002 EPS will represent a 15 \u2013 18% rise from EPS of $1.65 in 2001.  For the longer term, Wendy\u2019s maintains long-term annual EPS growth of 12% \u2013 15%.\nGrowth Report finds this to be positive news and we continue to be bullish on the long-term prospects for the company and the stock.\nBlockbuster a Copy Cat\u2026\nIn a nice gesture of flattery, video rental chain Blockbuster announced that it is currently testing its own version of an on-line DVD rental service.  The service is clearly a knock off of the booming subscription service currently offered by NetFlix ( Nasdaq: NFLX), a Growth Report Portfolio company.\nWhile Blockbuster will not go out of business due to the pressures and decline of market share as a result of DVD rental alternative NetFlix, it is clear that NetFlix has had an affect on Blockbuster in the recent months \u2013 thus the rational behind Blockbuster getting into DVD-by-mail business.\nShares of Netflix remain fairly inactive, closing at $12.85 a share.\nSubscribe NOW...\nIn order to stay abreast of all Portfolio changes and alerts, new stock and sector picks, and to receive the Print Version of Growth Report, please register for a FREE trial to the PREMIUM Growth Report Newsletter by following this link:    http://www.growthreport.com/register.asp\nHappy Investing,\nIan Wyatt\nPublisher\nGrowth Report\nWe appreciate your feedback!

I think we need to force ourselves to have a solid process for dealing with partners when they develop projects themselves otherwise we could get stuck allocating lots of resources for helping them with everything under the sun.  And we'll have a difficult time booking our resources accurately.\nHere was my message:\nI would think that Rishi would handle the closing out of Phase 1 which only has the task of moving the  already completed  application to COLO once the hosting agreement is signed.  Really just coordinating between Ops and AE once the deal is signed.\nAny future plans with Accenture regarding new projects with USPS need to be reviewed to see how they work within the AvocadoIT structure as it appears that Phase 2 does not involve any typical Project Management since Accenture is doing the development themselves.  With Accenture doing development themselves, this is really a true  licensed  development project which may need  development support  within AvocadoIT (as planned with Partners in the license model), but not with Project Management help unless that is a separate consulting service offered.\nThanks.\nDarshan", "output": "Lisa - Person Name, Rishi - Person Name, Accenture - Organizations, AvocadoIT - Organizations, Accenture - Organizations, Accenture  - Organizations, AvocadoIT - Organizations, Darshan - Person Name"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "I just tested the smart phone app on test server1 and it seems to be working the same as before.

I believe everything was blown out of proportion and once again we entered another terrific blowup.  Lending the money was not the issue, I honestly don't remember what I said in the past so I am not going to argue that point but yes I did think there was another motive for coming up to talk with me.  For that I apologize and am truly sorry.  I am not going to defend myself on what people said I told them because I hope you believe that I wouldn't call you such a name in church or behind your back.  I would tell you to your face but I don't think that at all, and that is the truth.\nJason, friends try to bring out the best in each other not encourage a stagnate state where positive growth does not happen.  When things are good for us they are good but when they are bad, it is uglier than ugly.  You know me quite well, more than I probably realize and that is why you are able to hit so many of my buttons; however, I am not willing to be repeatedly and consistently abused in any manner, via email or what is closest at hand.  It doesn't matter that you may treat many of your friends like this but I am not willing to continue our friendship if this is how it is going to be all the time.  I deserve better and so do you.\nI don't know the answers here but we need to stay away from each other until we can grow up and act like adults, not like teenagers in a constant state of chaos.  I won't be at church for the next three weeks so no worries about having another incident.  Nor do I want to go out of my way to avoid you, that is childish on my part because after all this is said and done (and there has been plenty of that)  I think you are one of the greatest persons I know.  That may sound like a contradiction on my part but that is how I feel.  Well, I will continue to watch the Giants continue their winning streak and hope for the best, with everything.

Two items are of particular interest:  their head of Software Strategy will be speaking aobut a  tech recession  and the guy who covers some of their mobile software infrastructure will be speaking about companies new focus on ROI, highlighting Openwave/Phone.com\nRon\nWhat to Expect from the CSFB Software CC Today\nSoftware Strategy - Preview of the Software Strategy Conf Call\nGeorge Gilbert - Where to Look For if We Are in a 'Tech Recession ?\nWe believe the dot.com bubble appears likely to expand somewhat into a wider\ncapital spending slowdown.  Many co's are already reporting less linearity\nin their quarters.  1st tier vendors are expanding share as customers invite\nfewer vendors to each evaluation.  Although public IT Services co's have\nseen a severe slowdown, software co's see them as separate channel from core\nBig 5 Systems Integrators. What became most clear last week was that\nself-service Enterprise Information Portals (EIP) are the next step in Web\napplications beyond personalization.  The biggest beneficiaries will\nprobably be the Web application server vendors. We believe vendors facing\nstrongest demand: SEBL (Siebel Systems, $73.4, Strong Buy) , EPNY\n(e.Piphany, $37.8, Strong Buy), VRTS (Veritas, $13.5, Restricted) , BEAS\n(BEA Systems, $58.8, Strong Buy).

However, we are seeing a\nsector rotation towards apps that deliver  an immediate and measurable ROI.\nWe believe a shift in spending patterns will favor supply chain/marketplace\ninfrastructure vendors such as ITWO (i2 Tech, $88, Strong Buy), and AGIL\n(Agile Software, $50, Buy). But who could possibly hurt would be: BVSN\n(Broadvision, $19.1, Buy) and KANA (KANA, $12, Buy).\nInternet Infrastructure Software - Preview of Software Conference Call\nTodd Raker - Where to Look if We are in a 'Tech Recession'?\nFocus from the co's in our group appears to be on proving immediate ROI in\nterms of the end capabilities to their customers. We believe that network\nsecurities stocks will remain very strong going into next 12 months. We\nbelieve that incremental demand is weakening on the margin (dot.com exposure\nappears to be an issues for most co's in our space).  Our thesis is not\nconcerned so much with who whether numbers will be missed are not but more\nwith which co's and by how much will outperform. We would highlight OPWV\n(Openwave, $52.2, Strong Buy) which has an interesting ROI story and VRSN\n(VeriSign, $87, Strong Buy).\nEnabling Infrastructure for Post-PC Era\n************************************\nRon D Silverton\nDirector of Strategic Marketing\nAvocadoIT, Inc.\n2211 North First Street\nSuite 200\nSan Jose, CA 95131\nTel: 408.562.8039\nMobile: 415.845.6789\nFax:  408.562.8100\nrsilverton@avocadoit.com\n************************************", "output": "Ron - Person Name, George Gilbert - Person Name, SEBL (Siebel Systems, $73.4, Strong Buy) , EPNY\n(e.Piphany, $37.8, Strong Buy), VRTS (Veritas, $13.5, Restricted) , BEAS\n(BEA Systems, $58.8, Strong Buy).

We just need to do a switch (tommorrow) and notify support, and give DNS some time to switch over by end of week.\nNOTE: the box that's on the table is DOA.  I found this out AFTER mounting it on the top (UGH).  threw my back out doing it too :}  (and if u were wondering steve, no I'm not coming in tommorrow anyways :} )\nWe'll have to get that repaired.  I don't remember my posts, but I think it was one long, three short which if memory serves me (haha, no pun intended), it's a memory issue.  The box won't even boot.  I'll look at it later on when we have the time.  If avocadoit / accenture happens, avocadoit can have that box *hehe*\nNetras:  put the two netras on top of jakarta.  predictive one is not mounted.  Tony's fucking .103 problem still exists and I can KICK myself for not fucking fixing it before I moved it.  The server loads up emas and netscape on bootup (/etc/rc3.d/S99ecs and S99nes).  the S99nes is what causes the problem.  Tony in his infinite wisdom, set it to automatically put the password into the https server.  BUT, what happens is after it gets to that point, input is no longer allowed on the console since the command prompt never comes back !!!! TONY!!!!!!!! ARGH\nanyways, since it's in this condition, I can't get to the box whatsoever without booting off of solaris cdrom and boot into rw safe mode and mount the disk and get rid of the script...  foo\nanyways, the aenetra one is up and I'll be working on setting fidelity up on that one first.  I'll have to make another trip to uunet to finish the other one though and bring the solaris CD with me.  Maybe tommorrow, maybe wednesday.  I set the IP's 10.8.4.110 and 10.8.4.111.  I have hooked both up to network and to the terminal console. (ports 10 and 11 I think)\nI got the small terminal console in my trunk.  I will bring that back to the office.  We can probably use it for something later.\nI took the two kvm's and most (if not all) of the kvm cables and brought them to uunet.  Will hook up later this week if not next depending on how much time I have.  With these two additionals, we should be OK for setting up the kvm's.  I would REALLY like to see the docs that come with these so I can configure the spanning correctly.\nI have gone through and totally yanked all the wiring in exodus that's not in use now.  It's all sitting in one ugly pile where the upshot box used to sit.  Need boxes to box it up and take to uunet/office.\nTommorrow I'll bring up the two NT boxes and continue working on the solaris box for fidelity transfer.  From my perspective, fidelity is the only thing left then to get up and running.  The go2 transfer can totally wait until we get time to deal with it now that we have some extra netras.\nAll we have left then is to wait until fidelity is finally moved over, secured behind the router with another subnet, and then configured properly and we should be good to go.  Once that's all done, we can get another truck and move the rest of the shit out of exodus and be done with them.\nFinal note:  we move out of exodus finally and what happens?

Morgan| Along Those Lines ... \nThe United States Constitution, Article I, Section 2, called for the taking of the census, stating that,  The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. \nMost American family history researchers are familiar with the U.S. federal census records, particularly the Population Schedules, which we used to establish the presence of our ancestors and their families in a specific place at a particular point in time. While we are familiar with the decennial censuses, many are unaware of the 1885 census. While not everyone will benefit from the use of the 1885 records, it is important to recognize that another census was taken that year. In this week's  Along Those Lines . . .  column, let's explore the history of the 1885 census.\nSome Census Background\nThe first U.S. census was taken in 1790. The new Congress funded the enumeration in accordance with the Constitution. The actual enumerations for the 1790 through 1870 censuses were performed by assistant federal marshals. During this period, Congress funded each of the censuses to be taken but there was no official census department or bureau. After each census, the statistical work was handled and the group handling the activity was disbanded until the next census.\nThe 1880 census was an important one for many reasons. First, the Census Office was the recipient of a hefty increase in funding. It was given the authority to hire its own enumerators; the assistant federal marshals no longer conducted the activity. Second, formal enumeration districts were for the first time defined and described to help insure that every inhabitant was enumerated by the new staff of census workers. Finally, the census listed for the first time the relationship between residents within each household.\nWhat Happened in 1885?\nOn 3 March 1879, Congress passed an act that provided that any state or territory could conduct an inter-decennial census, which would be partially funded by the federal government. Only the states of Colorado, Florida, and Nebraska, and the Dakota and New Mexico Territories availed themselves of the opportunity.\nThe 1885 census was conducted using the official  census day  of 1 June 1885 and consisted of four (4) schedules:\n--- Schedule 1: Inhabitants - Includes houses, inhabitants, their color, gender, age, relationship to head of household, marital status, occupation, place of birth, parents' birthplace, literacy, and any illness or disability.\n--- Schedule 2: Agriculture - Includes the name of the farmer, the duration of tenancy, acreage, farm value, expenses, value of farm products, type of livestock and numbers, and the type and quantity of produce.\n--- Schedule 3: Products of Industry - Includes the name of the owner or parent company, name of the business, amount of capital invested, number of employees, wages, hours, number of months operated each year, value of materials used, value of products, and the amount and type of power used in the production of the products. (This was the last manufacturing census conducted.)\n--- Schedule 5: Mortality - Includes information about persons who died in the year ending 31 May 1885. It includes the name, age, gender, color, marital status, place of birth, parents' birthplace, occupation, cause of death, and length of illness.\nWhat Records Exist?\nCopies of the census schedules were returned to the Department of the Interior in Washington, DC, and the originals were to have been retained by the states. There are, however, missing areas and some missing schedules.\n--- Colorado. The state copy exists at the Colorado State Archives in Denver; the federal copy is at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and has been microfilmed as publication M158. Ancestry.com is in the process of posting the 1885 census database online at its subscription website.\n--- Dakota Territory. The census for the northern half of the territory is located at the State Archives and Historical Research Library in Bismarck. A searchable online database for all counties in the northern Dakota Territory except Grand Forks County can be accessed here.\n--- Florida. The state copy is at the Florida State Archives at the Florida State Library and has been microfilmed. William T. and Patricia Martin have compiled an every-name index to this census which they sell bound for the entire state or at county level. The federal copy also is at NARA and has been microfilmed as publication M84 (13 rolls).\n--- Nebraska. The state copy is at the State Historical Society in Lincoln; the federal copy is at NARA and has been microfilmed as publication M352 (56 rolls). Ancestry.com has the 1885 census database online at its subscription website. Also, visit the Nebraska USGenWeb site where a few counties have been transcribed by volunteers.\n--- New Mexico Territory. The state copy is at the State of New Mexico's State records Center and Archives in Santa Fe; the federal copy is at NARA and has been microfilmed as publication M846 (6 rolls).\nSummary\nNeedless to say, with the loss of the population schedules of the 1890 U.S. federal census, the existence of census materials from 1885 for these five areas can be crucial to your research. In addition, if you are searching for immigrant ancestors who arrived after the 1880 census was taken and prior to 1885, and who settled in one of these areas, the information may be invaluable.\nHappy hunting!\nGeorge\nGeorge G.

I decided to use this number system to cross-reference my source citations to the actual sources. I put my documents and photos into sheet protectors and fastened them into binders. I then made tab dividers for each numbered source in my genealogy program and filed the documentation by those numbers.\nFor example, many of my ancestors were born in the Brockton, MA area. This is source No.1 in the genealogy program. All of the documents that I have from the city of Brockton are behind tab No.1- City of Brockton in the binder. I now have all of my documents organized and at my fingertips (so far!) and if I want to cite a source in either my genealogy program or in a family history narrative, I can use my universal numbering system and be able to quickly reference my sources. So far, it has worked well for me.\nJolynn Noel Winland\nThanks to Jolynne for Today's Quick Tip.

The senator invites all who wish to go, to be at fort Smith by the 1st of April. That this is the best route---that in 120 days they can be at San Francisco.

(VENTUREWIRE) -- Ants.com, a developer of technology that keeps address books up to date and an operator of an online marketplace for freelancers, said it has acquired the rights to the customers of Zkey, an identity and personal information management company. Zkey, which is changing its business model, said it will shut down its portal of free Web-based personal information applications to focus on licensing its intelligent mobile transactions software to wireless carriers and mobile service providers. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. As part of the deal, Ants.com will have the potential to add 300,000 registered Zkey users to Scout, its automated tool that manages electronic address books on PCs. Ants.com, which began as a marketplace for freelance workers and employers, launched Scout, its address book management product, in February. A company spokesperson said that while Ants.com would continue to operate the freelance end of the business, its main focus is now the address book technology. Ants.com also said that Nick Desai, CEO of Zkey, will join the Ants.com board of advisers. Zkey said it would inform its users this month that it will no longer offer a contact management service and will recommend the transition to Scout. Ants.com's investors include Bertelsmann Ventures and Millennium Hanson. Zkey is backed by Bear Ventures, France Telecom, Omninet Capital, Oracle, and Zone Ventures.\nhttp://www.ants.com <http://venturewire.net/comp.asp?l=http://www.ants.com>\nhttp://www.zkey.com <http://venturewire.net/comp.asp?l=http://www.zkey.com>\nYour Business  Everywhere\n***********************************************\nRon Silverton\nDirector of Strategic Marketing\nAvocadoIT, Inc\n2211 N First Street, Suite 200\nSan Jose CA, 95131\nw 408.562-8039\nm 415.845-6789\nf 408.5622-8100\nwww.avocadoit.com\n*************************************************", "output": "MobileSys - Organizations, Bitmo - Organizations, Ants.com - Organizations, Zkey - Organizations,  Zkey - Organizations, MobileSys - Organizations, Bitmo - Organizations, Ants.com - Organizations, Zkey - Organizations, http://venturewire.net/o_mailer.asp?sid=26816 - URL, http://venturewire.net/o_mailer.asp?sid=26816 - URL, Ants.com - Organizations, Zkey - Organizations, Zkey - Organizations, Ants.com - Organizations, Zkey - Organizations,  Ants.com - Organizations, Nick Desai - Person Name, Zkey - Organizations, Bertelsmann Ventures - Organizations, Millennium Hanson - Organizations, Bear Ventures, France Telecom, Omninet Capital, Oracle, and Zone Ventures. - Organizations, http://www.ants.com <http://venturewire.net/comp.asp?l=http://www.ants.com>\nhttp://www.zkey.com <http://venturewire.net/comp.asp?l=http://www.zkey.com> - URL, Ron Silverton - Person Name, AvocadoIT, Inc\n2211 N First Street, Suite 200\nSan Jose CA, 95131 - Address, w 408.562-8039\nm 415.845-6789\nf 408.5622-8100 - Phone Number, www.avocadoit.com - URL"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "id P9T6JCJ6; Mon, 24 Sep 2001 11:36:59 -0700\nby mailer.avocadoit.com (8.11.3/8.11.3) with SMTP id f8OI5XO09584\nfor <glenn.pereira@avocadoit.com>; Mon, 24 Sep 2001 11:05:33 -0700\nby mail.3pardata.com (8.9.3+Sun/8.9.3) with ESMTP id LAA17637\nfor <glenn.pereira@avocadoit.com>; Mon, 24 Sep 2001 11:32:40 -0700 (PDT)\nid <T2CCLWGF>; Mon, 24 Sep 2001 11:32:41 -0700\ncharset= iso-8859-1 \nHi,\nHey, I was talking to Andy the other day.

If the website has significantly changed then you may have to re-do the component identification on all the pages. So whatever time we typically take to do the component identification, will be the time it takes for the AEs to re-do the Salesforce.com website.  Of course, you will need to use the same amlvar names.  AEs do not have to re-do the rendering portion.  Is this what u have to do?  Is there anything else missing here?\nThanks.\nMark Tracy\nAvocadoIT, Inc.\n2211 North First Street, Suite 200, San Jose, CA  95131\nPhone: 408.562.8006 / Fax: 408. 588.0060", "output": "Glenn -

Also, feel free to forwardthis newsletter onto others, pass the wireless word.\n\u2013 AvocadoIT Unplugged Editor\nThe New Wave in Wireless\nAs the barriers that limit access fall away, businesses of every kind can now consider going wireless.\nBy Julie Gaeta\nIn California, utility company field service employees now use real-time messaging in emergencies to get power grids up and running quickly. A North Carolina construction firm routinely tracks shipments of materials for mistakes or oversights. When one is found, everyone at the building sites\u2014from the foremen to the electricians and welders\u2014is wirelessly updated using instant messaging. The right product is delivered at the right time and construction is completed without delay.\nMeanwhile, a fledgling, Chicago-based restaurant supply firm\u2019s fifteen sales reps and executives just got similar real-time access to company product pricing and availability, e-mail, and spreadsheets via their PDAs, enabling them to match the servicing powers of larger area competitors.\nFrom financial services like e*Trade\u2014offering real time stock information and wireless trading\u2014to Web applications such as onProject, which allows a virtual team to share and manage project information from wireless PDAs, increasing numbers of organizations of all kinds are reaping new and greater benefits of real-time communication.\nA recent study by Forrester Research reports that 40 percent of Fortune 2,500 businesses in the U.S. have either equipped or are equipping their workforces with wireless tools, while another 30 percent  are considering  wireless systems. With this kind of market penetration, the rumors of its delayed birth are greatly exaggerated: the wireless revolution has arrived.\nThere\u2019s good reason. The benefits of a wireless field force have been well documented, with increased efficiency, speed, and accuracy most frequently cited. According to Gartner Group, implementing wireless technology can make mobile workers 30 percent more productive overall. Employees, by starting their day in the field, can finish more jobs per day and jobs can be rerouted at a moment\u2019s notice. With instant access to two-way information, field personnel spot bottlenecks easily and make adjustments on the fly. Wireless boosts quality as well as quantity: information gathered at the point of activity is often much more accurate than what gets translated second-hand down the line.\n What we\u2019re really talking about here is business velocity,  says Delphi Group analyst Larry Hawes.  It seems like we can\u2019t go any faster, but we need to speed up the reaction time to opportunity.  At one national high-tech staffing and training firm the opportunities come and go so fast that it measures its response time in minutes, not days. That\u2019s why the company gave its 40 field salespeople real-time synchronization from a WAP-enabled device to their contact applications, e-mail, as well as faxes and voicemail.\nBreaking Down the Barriers\nThough the adoption of wireless technology is becoming more widespread, until recently a few factors prevented more businesses from buying in. Wireless service coverage lapses were a central concern. The time and cost involved in implementing a wireless solution has been another limiting factor. Now, new developments are beginning to break down such barriers to entry.\nSome wireless vendors have come up with innovative ways to fill in the coverage gaps. AvocadoIT, a San Jose-based provider of mobile application platforms and associated services, developed a solution which offers customers three modes of interaction\u2014online, offline and alerts\u2014ensuring that workers in the field are never at a loss for the real-time information they need to perform their jobs.\nWhen workers remain inside network coverage areas, the online mode allows them to be connected directly to their information and applications source. When they go out of network range, such as down in a basement or to remote locations, workers can switch to offline mode where they will continue receiving just the mission-critical information that is stored on their individual handheld device. When the employee is back inside the coverage area, any transactions or data input that have taken place during the offline time is automatically uploaded and synchronized with the central server.\nThe alert mode allows for proactive messages to be sent to the field, for example to alert a service worker to a change in routing or a salesperson to a hot lead needing immediate follow through.\nWireless Costs Come Down\nIn the relatively short time that handheld wireless devices have been available, not only have they become much more sophisticated but they have also become more affordable. With the price of handheld devices in the $300-$600 range, many companies are questioning the necessity of putting $3,000 laptops in the hands of service workers who don\u2019t really need the computing power and who find the additional bulk and lag time required to boot up the system a distinct disadvantage. The cost of the laptop itself is only the beginning. The resources required to support and maintain such systems triple the overall cost. According to Goldman Sachs, the total cost of an enterprise laptop is $10,000 per year compared with $2,000 per year for a wireless handheld device.\n Especially for areas like dispatch, where ease of use is paramount and where the interest is in the delivery of simple two-way communication such as e-mail, actionable alerts, and the like, then handheld wireless devices are the way to go,  says Larry Hawes. When choosing among Palms, RIMs, PCs or Pocket PCs, Hawes advises that companies consider what workers will be doing foremost with the device. The goal is to provide important data in an easy-to-read and easy-to-respond way.\nAs a case in point, consider the dilemma of one high-tech manufacturer with a field service force of 5000 strong. After investing heavily in a laptop-based wireless solution, the company had to scrap the system entirely. Since the solution was tied to a closed architecture legacy system, it took months and great expense to make any necessary changes or upgrades to the system. In one case, when each laptop had to be brought back to the IT department to be updated, deployment to the field alone took over two months.\nThe company is currently in the process of replacing the laptops with Compaq iPAQ Pocket PCs. The new system will be built on open standards and is browser-based so that when an application needs revising, the changes can be made on the server just once and are completely transparent to users, as are revisions to the system\u2019s offline components.\nHiring an Application Service Provider (ASP) is another way more businesses, especially small ones can overcome cost barriers or lack of IT resources while pursuing an aggressive wireless strategy. The ASP model allows companies to choose the types of applications they need for the price and number of users required, all for a set monthly fee\u2014similar to paying a mobile phone carrier or an ISP for service. The wireless ASP provides the applications, security, service level agreement, and transcoding needed between the network and myriad devices. Small and midsize companies can gain access to state-of-the-art technology that was very recently the domain of only the largest companies, without having to make significant capital outlays for hardware and software.\nIdeally, a company will choose a platform that supports any device and features intelligent routing capabilities so that the system will recognize which device and which network the user is on and then provide the most efficient response.\nThe Numbers: What about ROI?\nChoosing the right device and the right delivery method are crucial steps toward having the right information to the right place at the right time and, by extension, to achieve a swift and sure return on investment (ROI). One key advantage of the low cost of handheld devices and the steadily dropping cost of service in today\u2019s highly competitive wireless market is that companies doing ROI analyses no longer need to prove the wireless solution\u2019s benefits over an extended period of time.\nIn addition to the cost of the wireless device and the service fees, businesses do have to consider how the wireless solution will integrate with its existing applications. Rewriting business applications for the Web adds another level of unnecessary complexity to a company\u2019s information infrastructure. The quickest path to ROI involves leveraging investments that have already been made in existing applications. By integrating the wireless solution with existing applications, businesses can ensure that the information accessed in the field is accurate and up-to-date and that the resulting single infrastructure will support every form of access employees might need.\nEven though wireless technology links the enterprise, the field, and customers in faster, more collaborative and cost-effective ways than ever before, fiscally and tactically smart companies who invest in wireless systems know that a wireless platform investment must be both flexible and scalable to take advantage of new technological developments as they inevitably occur.\nWireless technology is still evolving very rapidly. Now is still much too soon to commit to one standard, such as WAP (wireless application protocol), or one device, such as a Palm or PDA. A good wireless solution should not only have open standards but also be extensible to other parts of the organization. So that while dispatch may standardize on a specific device or application, other types of devices are certain to gain favor with other members of the organization\u2014ending up in a situation where one person carries a Web phone, another a two-way pager, and another a wireless PDA. Any wireless solution worth its salt must be up to the task of supporting everyone, everywhere, all the time.\nWhile these current and prospective technical issues need careful attention, the minute real time messaging is in place the value will become apparent. At the Greensboro, North Carolina Engineering and Inspections Department, there are 32 inspectors in the field, each logging information on hand-held computers and transmitting it back wirelessly to the main office. By the end of the day, the code enforcement manager will have received nearly 600 inspections without ever having laid eyes on an inspector. Each of the 32 inspectors were able to add two hours of productivity by starting and ending their day in the field\u2014the equivalent of hiring eight additional inspectors.\nMany companies say that if they can handle or process a single additional customer per day per employee, the investment in wireless is justified. Some executives have already figured that if they can save 15 minutes per day per employee, it\u2019s worth a $5,000 investment in a wireless solution for that employee.\nThe bottom line is that the faster your field and sales forces have the information they need, the better off your business is going to be.\nJulie Gaeta is a Los Angeles-based business and technology writer.\ntop |  subscription\nNeed to Speed Up the Pace of the Recovery? Bring Everybody into Real Time!\nHello and welcome to the first issue of AvocadoIT Unplugged.\nDo you think that the purpose of mobile applications and wireless technologies is to deliver the Web as we have come to know and love it on our desktops out onto devices such as PDAs, telephones, pagers, and RIMs? Though it will be exciting if that happens, have you stopped to question if that is what you really want those applications to do?\nThe type of information that you and your customers usually need on the go is basic, but timely: order tracking, next or last available flights, stock updates and buys, traffic info to help reach an urgent appointment, price comparisons, or perhaps a few key lines from the Web site or intranet. The companies scoring the first wireless victories come up with inventive, user-friendly ways to leverage existing data and infrastructure onto mobile devices and get better as technologies develop and converge.\nWhile some observers have focused on various wireless devices\u2019 limitations, the lack of a standard protocol, and wireless broadband delays, those who look at the big picture see that for nearly twenty years, since the collapse of the mainframe as the backbone of corporate computing, businesses have been moving from centralized batch processing to distributed real-time processing. After billions and billions of dollars of investment, the end point of the system became the personal computer.\nNow we\u2019re at a point of diminishing returns: everybody including the customer is on the network and the real-time infrastructure touches anybody with a PC. Extending real-time access to mobile devices is simply the next, most logical step because field service and sales people still function mostly in batch mode, away from the corporate real-time infrastructure.\nNow you can make up-to-the-minute corporate database information available to all staff and customers and you can send critical, real-time information to anyone who depends on you, wherever they are. You can automate certain tasks for the first time, improve the productivity of remote workers, increase communication and collaboration between field and sales forces, and speed up orders, shipment, and the rest of the supply chain. Customers, employees, and partners can do business with you anytime, anywhere, on any device.\nSo no surprise that Internet access will be available on practically all of the one billion mobile devices to be sold by 2003\u2014or that almost all enterprises are expected to adopt mobile applications on a broad scale, joining many in the transportation, health care, financial services, manufacturing, and other industries who already have.\nBringing everybody into real time is a competitive necessity now and mobile applications are the only way to do it.\nIn this issue we present { insert title of feature article here } by Julie Gaeta, a look at businesses such as power utilities where minutes and even seconds make all the difference and real-time wireless data is the key to beat the clock. Also, there\u2019s  Mobilizing Data: Beyond the Glamour,  a survey of questions to ask before you mobilize your people and your business, written by independent wireless consultant Kelly Quinn.\nThere\u2019ll be plenty more in upcoming issues. We invite your questions and comments to { editor@avocadoitunplugged.com.}\nThank you for getting Unplugged!\ntop |  subscription\nMobilizing Data: Beyond the Glamour\nBy Kelly Quinn\nFor the past year, the idea of mobilizing data for the field workforce has been gaining momentum, both in the wireless industry and within enterprises. Cutting the cord for field workers, however, isn't an easy task--it requires deployment of services that integrate skill sets from both computing environments and from cutting edge wireless telephony environments. The needs of the field worker aren't a wireless version of the desktop but an entirely different set of interface elements that must be considered in order to deploy a useable solution.\nWhile selecting a vendor to help deploy a wireless solution is difficult enough, potential buyers must first determine if they should mobilize their employees at all. The Wireless Technologies at Aberdeen Group has identified five key questions that must be considered.\n1. Is there a need?\n Mobilized workforce  sounds glamorous and cutting edge, but what's the point of mobilizing anything unless there's a true business need? Before going through the process of mobilizing workers, companies must consider the main question:  Is there a need to have access to data in the field without access to a landline telephone connection?  If the answer is no, ask for the future. When the answer is yes, whether now or nine months down the road, they must also rationalize the remaining questions.\n2. What information needs to be mobilized?\nIs it field service information? Sales force information? Do employees need timely access to information about customer accounts while on site? Do employees need immediate access to information about product availability or supply chain status while on the road? Mobilizing enterprise data means making available the corporate resources that are essential to customer, satisfaction and retention. Wherever these issues are timely is where mobilization should be considered.\n3. With whom does the need exist?\nDoes every employee in the field need this technology? Some may, some may not. Companies must prudently identify which employees possess the greatest need for access to the information. One of the keys to increasing the benefit of mobilizing employees is\nknowing when and who not to mobilize.\n4. What's to be gained?\nWill wireless enable field service personnel to visit two more customer sites per day? Will it enable to visit ten more? Will wireless access enable sales personnel to increase the number of deals closed at the customer site? Will it reduce the time spent on administration for the sales force? What's the tangible benefit that will be gained by deploying this solution? While it's tantalizing to say,  We're the first to market with mobilized employees,  it's far more important to be able to say,  We're the first to market to increase our profits by X percent per quarter due to our wireless deployment. \n5. How are the potential gains quantified?\nThe gain must be quantified in order to prove its value. Does the wireless solution cut 25 minutes of administrative time out of each employee's day? What dollar value does that represent in savings? How many days, weeks or months of that savings will be required to recoup investment costs in the wireless solution? Is the time required to recover those costs reasonable? If not, at what point would the benefit of deploying a wireless solution outweigh the accompanying costs?\nClearly, there are no set answers to these questions across all enterprises. However, it's\nEssential that companies carefully answer each question for their own specific sets of needs before investing the time, money and human resources required to deploy wireless services.\n[Kelly Quinn is an independent consultant in Boston and was formerly a senior analyst in wireless technologies practice}\ntop |  subscription\nSubscribe:\nwww.avocadoit.com\nUnsubscribe:\nsend email to\nunsubscribe@avocadoit.com\nArchive:\nwww.avocadoit.com/unplugged /archive/\nEditor:\neditor@avocadoitunplugged.com\nAvocadoIT is an application service provider that mobilizes websites for the wireless web.

That's still not\nenough food, but its better than nothing. And they had a food auction for\nwhich they were given $500 in real Australian money to bid on different\nlittle plates of food. But that little bit of food didn't last them long,\nand it made them all feel miserable and have to go to the bathroom!\nTonight, they will be experiencing flooding. Should be interesting. Hope you\ncan watch it, but if you can't, I'll be happy to update you! I can't wait\nuntil tonight!

I think the issue is stability of one vs. the other.  Although money is good, the ability to set your own schedules and live more of the lifestyle that you love puts you in the category of consultant. The practical side of you that talks about money which I am assuming is the need to contribute your share to the whole of the house is not what makes you happy.  If you need money, then get contracts.  Probably the thing that has kept me away from the consulting thing is having to hassle for contracts and managing that life with that of 3 mouths to feed.  I always took the safe road.  If you have a choice, do what you love. The other factor hear is that you know what behind door number one relative to any office/desk job you get  Politics . Its everywhere and its nowhere, but it will always be in the way in the office.  Can you handle it, yes; do you want to no.\nIf you and Mike like the fact that you could spend the summers together traveling or rebuilding homes, you can only do that consulting.  If you do not want to deal with the BS that happens in the office on a daily basis, consulting is the way to go.  You can tell here that consulting has my vote, but there may be issues that I am not privy too.\nGotta go.\nI will talk to you later and oh by the way, Jimmy boy is getting a divorce.\nDouga...", "output": "Ms Nona. - Person Name, Mike - Person Name, Jimmy - Person Name, Douga... - Person Name"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "Hello Chris, I have received your production code drop.

So, ...\n-  Beth Osborne Daponte, a worker at the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that\n40,000 women and 32,000 children in Iraq died in the Gulf War.  Today,\nUNICEF estimates that 5000-6000 Iraqi children die each month from\nstarvation and malnutrition as a result of American sanctions. \nIt amazes me that with technology today we simply pass off a statement from\nsomeone as actual facts by simply giving a name and attaching where they\nwork:  In reality, the US Census Bureau has never estimated any civilian\ncasualties outside of a few hundred.  Even Iraq itself claimed very few\ncasualties.  I doubt if 5,000 children die each month.  That means over\n600,000 children have died in the last 10 years.  I would be surprised if\nthat number is close to their birth rate.  The sanctions are sponsored by\nthe United Nations, not just the US alone.  Iraq has used the money raised\nfrom selling oil to strip money out of its citizens and pumped it into the\ndevelopment of mass destruction weapons.  So while there is a measurable\nimpact on Iraqi citizens due to the UN sanctions, one could easily argue\nthey are no less than the initial negative impacts from the government's\ncampaign of sucking its own economy dry for military reasons.\n-  For years, the United States propped up the government of the Shah in\nIran since he opposed the Soviet Union.  They did this in spite of the fact\nthat he was a ruthless tyrant who was universally hated by his people.  It\nwas easy for the revolutionaries to label the U.S. as the  Great Satan  as\nhe was toppled from power. \nWhat does this even mean?  Propped up?  Does this mean we deserve to be\nattacked by terrorists because we supported a leader that some of his people\nhated?\n-  To this day, hundreds of Palestinians die from attacks by Isrealis, using\nweapons that were supplied by the United States.  The entire region lives\nin fear of Israel's nuclear arsenal that was basically supplied by the\nUnited States. \nThe number of Palestinian attacks against Israel outnumber Israel's by 3 to\n1.  Israel is surrounded by dozens of anti-Israel countries.  If not for the\nUnited States' support, an entire people and culture (Israel) would have\nbeen removed from the earth years ago.  Israel typically follows the same\nmilitary program as the United States - only retaliate when attacked first.\nWhy would little old Israel try to start trouble with dozens of other\ncountries that it knows it cannot outnumber?  While certainly not the patron\nsaints of the world, they have been the #1 location of terrorist attacks for\nmany decades.\n If we attack Afghanistan, all we'll do is kill thousands of innocent people\nand give the Arab world one more reason to hate the United States.  Even if\nwe managed to take out bin Laden by some miracle, as long as they hate the\nWest, there will be someone willing to kill innocent American\ncitizens.  The only way we can eliminate terrorism is to eliminate the root\ncauses of terrorism: this hatred of the United States. \nJust as with Iraq, we will not go in and bomb Afghanistan.  Our leaders are\nvery well aware of the fact that it is not a nation attacking us but rather\none extreme, fanatical group or groups.   We will have specific campaigns\nonly against terrorist camps and logistics locations.  And let's not forget\nthat once again, its not just the United States - this will be an\ninternational force.  I would be interested to hear if the United States is\nat fault, why are nearly 50 countries ready to join in support to rid the\nworld of these terrorists?  Our intent, nor never will be, to simply to kill\nthousands of innocent people as a form of retaliation.\nI am of the opinion that the Arab nations have been looking for guidance and\nsupport to rid themselves of these fanatics and now they have it.  We\nunderstand that the Saudis have basically been told to make sure nothing\nhappens to the oil fields and that a free-flowing supply remains available\nto us.  The same thing to the other Gulf States--they understand what is\nbeing said and have assured us that OPEC will take care of it.\nThis is not the time for  sunshine patriots  but for people who love America\nand will support her through thick and thin.  The times have changed: the\nUSA has been attacked on our own soil.  This is an act of war.  When Admiral\nYamamoto was asked after the Pearl Harbor attack what he thought, he\nresponded:  I fear we have awakened a sleeping tiger.    Our nation for many\nyears has acted like a  paper tiger  but now we have been awakened like NO\none under thet age of 60 remembers.\nI am thankful and grateful for being an American citizen.  At an early age I\nwas able to see the difference of countries with and without freedom (ie,\nEast and West Germany, Berlin).  I have walked on the ground of Dachau and\nfelt the spirit of those that died by the hand of evil men.  I worry about\nthe hatred and prejudice now brought to birth in our own nation to those\nthat have to come America for a better life, chance for freedom and to add\nto what makes this nation great.  Much was lost last week, not just lives.\nAs Francis Scott Key so eloquently said,  then conquer we must, when our\ncause it is just.   So with having said more than enough... I close.\nElisabeth Whaley", "output": "17 Sep 2001 - Date, Elisabeth.Whaley@avocadoit.com - Email, 17 Sep 2001 - Date, Elisabeth.Whaley@avocadoit.com - Email, 17 Sep 2001 - Date, 17 Sep 2001 - Date, lds-chat@lists.Stanford.EDU - Email, 17 Sep 2001 - Date, Mon, 17 Sep 2001 - Date, Beth Osborne Daponte - Person Name, U.S. - Location, U.S. Census Bureau - Organizations, Iraq - Location, Gulf  - Location, UNICEF - Organizations, US - Location, US Census Bureau - Organizations, Iraq - Location, United Nations - Organizations, US - Location, Iraq - Location, UN - Organizations, United States - Location, Iran - Location, Soviet Union - Location, U.S - Location, United States - Location, Israel' - Location, United States.\" - Location, Israel' - Location, Israel - Location, United States' - Location, Israel - Location, Israel - Location, United States - Location, Israel - Location, Afghanistan - Location, Arab world - Location, United States - Location, bin Laden - Person Name, United States - Location, Iraq - Location, Afghanistan - Location, United States - Location, United States - Location, Arab nations - Location, OPEC - Location, America - Location, USA - Location, Yamamoto - Person Name, Pearl Harbor  - Location, East and West Germany, Berlin - Location, Dachau - Location, America - Location, Francis Scott Key - Person Name, Elisabeth Whaley - Person Name"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "If they are paper tickets then they will be delivered downstairs and they will call us upon their arrival.

EUROPEAN OPERATORS CHARGING TOO MUCH FOR GPRS\nWireless operators in Europe are charging too much for GPRS service and will\nfail unless they charge less, a new study has claimed.\n While we understand the need for operators to recoup 2.5/3G network and\nservice development costs as soon as possible, without lower and more\nflexible pricing we seriously doubt that consumers will be enthused and that\na mass market will be created,  said Farid Yunus, an analyst at Yankee\nGroup, the firm behind the report.\nThe study surveyed European operators and found what it calls a lack of\nconsistency and innovation in terms of pricing.\n The favoured model at present is to charge by the amount of data consumed, \nsaid Yunus.  This has been determined for the most part by legacy billing\nplatforms and capabilities, but given the diversity and range of future data\napplications, this approach will prove inadequate both in the long term and\nin stimulating demand right now. \nAs of now, the average monthly cost to consumers for 10 MB of data is around\n$170, the study found. The cost rises to $1,500 for 100 MB. Pricing for\nbusiness is somewhat more reasonable at about $230 per month for 100MB, but\nthe cost-per-megabyte for less data is extremely high, the study found.\n20.

At the time, I did not know and was very disturbed by the news.  I had gone by his house in the early days of my leaving HP and he was never there.  I stopped going by and we lost contact.\nWhen I am in Palo Alto, I think about you guys all the time.  I keep in touch with Cynthia Duhon (Cannon) and have spoken to June and Judy Raye in the last 6 months.  Everyone seems to be well. June and Cynthia are both retired, I don't know about Judy, although she is still with HP.  I have not spoke to Meadow for years, I know she married a preacher and that was the last I heard.  Rosalyn's sister still works for HP and just transferred back to California from Atlanta.  We went to the HP picnic at Great America and I ran into Ray and Sue.  I asked about you first, and then about Dan.  He told me that he and Sue were going to retire in the next year and that Dan had already retired and moved to Roseville; what about you?  When are you going to turn it in?  Have you heard from or seen Margaret Mouton?  This is one person that I would really know about.  No one seems to know anything about her life at this point.\nRetirement will be awhile for me, I just started (2.5 months) with a startup in San Jose, and hoping that it will go public and make me some big money.  This will be the last one though.  Ros is also at a startup and her's will probably go public before mine.  If so, I hope that it goes big, then I will retire on her money.\nThe company that I work for is called AvocadoIT.  We just moved into the Novell building here in San Jose right off first street.  It is across from the airport.  The building is nice, with all the comforts.  It has a gym, a BB court, tennis courts, volleyball, etc.  I know, because I see them all on my way to the cafe.\nThe boys are growing and trying my patience every day.  Jordan is 10 and Zack is 5.  Ros wanted a girl, but I said no!  Jordan has the gift, but unfortunately, he has my demeanor.  He will only play to the level of his competition and when he wants too.  I am trying to break him of that, but that creates fights between me and his mom, because I have to be tough on him.  He appears to like baseball the most right now and has good glove and hits well.  He won MVP of the all stars this past year.  He says that he does not want to play next year, but we will see.  Zack starts this year and he should be tough as he as tried to keep up with Jordan and has developed his skills.\nWell I am off to class to learn about the product that my group will be supporting.  I am in class all week, but if I get a break towards the end of the week, I will give you a call.\nI called Jerri a couple of weeks ago, but we only exchanged voice mail.\nThis time I am really gone. I hope that you and your family are well and expecting a great holiday season.\nTalk to you later.\nDouga...\nDirector, Technical Support\nAvocadoIT Inc.\n(408) 562-7985", "output": "Jose - Person Name, HP - Organizations, Palo Alto - Location, Cynthia Duhon (Cannon) - Person Name, June - Person Name, Judy Raye - Person Name, June  - Person Name, Cynthia - Person Name, Judy - Person Name, HP. - Organizations, Meadow - Person Name, Rosalyn's - Person Name, HP - Organizations, California - Location, Atlanta - Location, HP - Organizations, Great America - Location, Ray - Person Name, Sue - Person Name, Dan - Person Name, Sue - Person Name, Dan - Person Name, Roseville - Location, Margaret Mouton - Person Name, San Jose - Location, Ros - Person Name, AvocadoIT - Organizations, Novell building here in San Jose right off first street.

They are attempting to broaden their reach beyond brokerage and recently gained their first non-brokerage win with FedEx for package tracking (again, we lost to them).  Both of these companies have very sophisticated IT departments, which is a credit to W-tech.  However, my sense is part of the reason we lost was our relative immaturity (both of product and in selling skills) during those engagements; for example, we did not have XML support when we spoke with Fido.\nSince then we have also beaten them - in Quicken for example.\nW-tech's strength is in providing mobile applications and professional services that will do intergration for the customer.   They do not leverage HTML, but companies like Fido don't want this.  Rather, companies can quickly understand benefit derived from implementing their preconfigured applications (W-tech has a suite of about 20  mobile solutions  in several segments). With its recent shift to a platform company and transition to a licensed product, the offering gains appeal. They already support alert generation and claim to offer offline capabilities as well. However, I do not believe this is a product that will be succesful long term given its architecture - its a tactical patch while companies wait out next 1-2 years.\nW-tech is know to compete aggressively on price. They get little unpaid recognition from the analyst community despite their sizeable customer base and longevity (1997 is old in this space).\nIn terms of our position in FSI, let me couch this by saying that Ray R is probably closer to this than I am.  However, in my opinion banking and brokerage are the most competitive sectors. Most if not all of the early adopters and innovators have already selected a solution provider. The top competitors in this space include the largest and best known pure plays, inc Aether, 724 Solutions and of course w-tech. In addition, Air2Web has traction in this space with an online bank and 2 online banking service providers as customers. Even Brience is allegedly in Washington Mutual (we were there and then somehow didn't get invited back). Further, there are companies going after the little guys, such as Senscom, which targets community banks and credit unions.\nThere are factors that make FSI attractive. FSIs are big into technology, financial transactions can be completed electronically, some are time sensitive and have significant monetary value and there are big banks all over the world. Our current capabilities are also well suited toward b2c applications (including iTV story), though we need to strengthen our support for transactions systems on the back-end (so does everyone else). Further, I have recently noticed a strong increase in the interest level from insurance companies. Unlike banking and brokerage, where the applications are b2c, insurance providers are exploring b2e applications -such as accelerating the claim cycle, reducing amount of transcription, and seling new services/reducing deductable immediately following catastrophic event - when consumer is most vulnerable... I mean amenable to the sale. To our credit, we have a solid customer in ETRADE - which we can point to as banking and brokerage. Expanding this account globally will help with credibility in those markets but its still not viewed as an establishment company or real threat in most markets outside US. Fleet would be a big win, as would S&P and Banamex (724 is already in Mexico).  With Accenture's aid I think we'd be strongly positioned.\nIn summary, I think FSI is an intersting vertical. However, absent AC (or perphaps CGEY) stating they want to aggressively pursue this vertical with us and build a solution around it, I think its going to be an ugly battle.  Our sales people don't understand FSI (except Ray) - and as you know, its a very different animal than other industries (even within insurance or banking there are significant differences). Banks have lots of proprietary back-end sytems, so our connector/EAI story will provide little - especially since we don't have the key partners - 724 and Aether do.\nPersonally, I think the utilities are an interesting sector.  I haven't really looked into it, but I do know that for years it has had wireless data solutions (for field service) but that utilities are now realizing there are better ways to go. Utilities are immune to recession, and outside of California should have cash.\nRon\nEnabling Infrastructure for Post-PC Era\n************************************\nRon D Silverton\nDirector of Strategic Marketing\nAvocadoIT, Inc.\n2211 North First Street\nSuite 200\nSan Jose, CA 95131\nTel: 408.562.8039\nMobile: 415.845.6789\nFax:  408.562.8100\nrsilverton@avocadoit.com\n************************************", "output": "W-Tech - Organizations, W-tech - Organizations, Senscom - Organizations, US - Location, Mexico - Location, Accenture's  - Organizations, Ray - Person Name, California - Location, Ron D Silverton - Person Name, AvocadoIT, Inc.\n2211 North First Street\nSuite 200\nSan Jose, CA 95131 - Address, 408.562.8039 - Phone Number,  415.845.6789 - Phone Number, 408.562.8100 - Phone Number, rsilverton@avocadoit.com - Email"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "id HCA96NQN; Thu, 11 Apr 2002 12:20:11 -0700\nby mailer.avocadoit.com (8.11.3/8.11.3) with SMTP id g3BJJnv11668\nfor <fernand@avocadoit.com>; Thu, 11 Apr 2002 12:19:49 -0700\nby host13.the-web-host.com (8.10.2/8.10.2) id g3BJJmj19993\nfor fernand@avocadoit.com; Thu, 11 Apr 2002 15:19:48 -0400\nResent-Date: Thu, 11 Apr 2002 15:19:48 -0400\nX-Authentication-Warning: host13.the-web-host.com: bchild set sender to bc-orgy-request@brainchildentertainment.com using -f\nMakoto <discover_3@yahoo.com>,\n Richardson, Jason  <Jason.Richardson@ihe.com>,\norgy@brainchildentertainment.com, bc-orgy@brainchildentertainment.com\nResent-Message-ID: < fzB76D.A.wwE.VGet8 @host13.the-web-host.com>\nResent-From: bc-orgy@brainchildentertainment.com\nX-Mailing-List: <bc-orgy@brainchildentertainment.com> archive/latest/60\nX-Loop: bc-orgy@brainchildentertainment.com\nPrecedence: list\nResent-Sender: bc-orgy-request@brainchildentertainment.com\n--0-821068863-1018552723=:17667\n--0-821068863-1018552723=:17667\n--0-821068863-1018552723=:17667--\nWassssssuuuuuup! ... just wanted to be part of this silly spam.\nmacD\nLeon <leton2002@yahoo.com> wrote:\nIT'S CALLED AN ADDRESS BLOCK...YAHOO HAS THIS FEATURE YALL..HAHAHA...LAST TIME YOU HEAR FROM ME.\nBishop <lowlo@yahoo.com> wrote:\ndoes anyone know why all this stuff is coming to me?\n--- Makoto wrote:\n> Look brah, I don't know what your problem is but you\n> need help.

Now that we have declared ourselves to become a major player in Financial Services, 7/24, Aether, Air2Web and W-Technologies have been coming at us in a fierce way.\nThere is a lot of FUD in the marketplace now trying to position us as a screen scraper or that they have a solution just like ours.

We have not been the first one in the door for most of the financial services account opportunities\nwe are currently working on, but we are starting to build a lot of traction in accounts that we had not contacted previously. In these accounts we are still spending a\nconsiderable amount of time trying to educate clients about the marketplace and why we are different. This is causing significant delays in the decision making process.\nAs a result of the competition, customers are also getting smarter about how to position one vendor against the other which is causing more delays and pricing pressures.\nAir2Web is now quoting as their standard pricing for a hosted solution, $4,000/month for up to 1000 users. That does not compare well to our pricing of $15,000/month for\n1000 users (100 concurrent). This pricing may not include all of the costs associated with support for wireless applications, but this is what a client sees first and tends to\nset expectations based on this low number. We have to be prepared to justify our costs based on the superior products and services that we are providing.\n2. Though competition is tough, we are still building great traction. Signing FleetBoston and hopefully Banamex, Zions, ABN Amro and TRowePrice will significantly\nstrengthen our market position.\nREALIZE THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY NEW MAJOR CLIENT SIGNINGS IN FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETPLACE BY ANY OF OUR MAJOR\nCOMPETITORS IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS EXCEPT FOR CITITRADE IN DECEMBER.\n3. Our Partners such as Accenture and HP have been starting to build some momentum. With Accenture we are currently working on the account strategies for BankOne, GE Capital, JPMorgan Chase, Hartford Insurance, Vanguard and a few others. With HP it is with Bear Stearns, Ben Norte and Bancomer.  We expect to get many more leads from HP once the HP North American Tour gets started on February 28th going through May 2nd.\nOur direct sales force has now working on accounts such as Firstar/US Bancorp, Federated Investors, NASDAQ, CIBC, Dresner, S&P, Thomson Financial and Salomon, Smith Barney. Many of these we expect to see closed in the second quarter of this year.\n4. On the reseller/OEM partner front, FISERV has expresses continued interest in our software platform and will attempt to have AvocadoIT present to their Technology/Steering committee  in the next few weeks. FISERV has over 90 different businesses with separate P/L all focused on the financial services industry.  They have over 500 banks as their customers today in the US and in Europe.\nOur continued efforts to recruit Corillian, a major internet banking software vendor as an OEM partner is being delayed because of an existing agreement Corillian has\nwith 7/24.  A decision about Corillian will be made by the end of the quarter. Additional conversations have also been initiated with Financial Fusion and Brokat.\nWe are building our momentum in the Financial Services Marketplace. The firms are now becoming aware of us as a major player which will lead to more opportunities being uncovered over the next few months. With an upturn in the north american economy in the second half of this year, I expect to achieve our objectives in Financial Services Industry in 2001.\nRay Rahamin\nGeneral Manager\nFinancial Services Industry\nAvocadoIT\nOffice: 914-773-0593\nCell   : 914-645-6617\nFax  : 914-773-0595\nRay.Rahamin@avocadoit.com", "output": "7/24 - Date, Aether, Air2Web and W-Technologies - Organizations, FleetBoston and hopefully Banamex, Zions, ABN Amro and TRowePrice - Organizations, CITITRADE - Organizations, Accenture and HP - Organizations, Accenture - Organizations, BankOne, GE Capital, JPMorgan Chase, Hartford Insurance, Vanguard - Organizations, HP it is with Bear Stearns, Ben Norte and Bancomer. - Organizations, February 28th - Date, May 2nd. - Date, Firstar/US Bancorp, Federated Investors, NASDAQ, CIBC, Dresner, S&P, Thomson Financial and Salomon, Smith Barney. - Organizations, US and in Europe - Location, Corillian - Organizations, Ray Rahamin - Person Name, Office: 914-773-0593\nCell   : 914-645-6617\nFax  : 914-773-0595 - Phone Number, Ray.Rahamin@avocadoit.com - Email"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "Exodus was back up as of 8:30pm.

Wireless IT was\nattended by over three times as many individuals this year over last and the\nfloor space for next year is already 50% sold out.\nHere's a look at the BUZZ From the Convention Floor\u2026\nVC See?\nThere is too much VC money out there, according to many of the attendees I\nspoke with. The joke about being one of 60 companies exhibiting at the show\ndoing the same thing is no joke. Greedy investors, flush from big Internet\nwins, are pouring money into me-too wireless ideas. While the heads of these\ncompanies are all looking to be bought soon, despite protestations to the\ncontrary about building a sustainable business, they are doing themselves a\ndisservice by not partnering now with other small companies. When the market\nis saturated in 6 months and the money dries up, the remnants could be\nscooped up and combined by Vulture Capitalists. Better to do it yourself now\nand hedge your bets.\nAvocadoIT: The MSFT of Wireless\nEverybody in the valley has an I hate Microsoft story. AvocadoIT is getting\na similar rep among start-ups. Success breeds contempt.\nCritics claim AvocadoIT has no sustainable technology, few paying customers\nand a decreasing client list. PR reps and company spokespeople will\ntell you different, but what really counts is the word on the street. One\nbrazen CEO claimed if AvocadoIT had any smarts, they'd buy his company to\nget some real technology. Sort of a reverse merger into IPO. Needless to\nsay, the CEO wasn't selling, and it's doubtful that Venk is buying.\nIronically, though, much of the competition is hoping these early movers\nshake this pre-IPO malaise. If AvocadoIT leads the wireless application\ncompanies to the public markets and fails, it's bad news for everybody in\nthe industry.\nBest Pairing for Celebrity Death Match\nThe Giant Bear bear and the Zucotto chef.

Without that they really have few solid customers and partners.  Let's take a closer look at these claims.\nFirst off, their burn rate.  They now claim to have over 300 employees. While I don't know what their burn rate is at the moment, looking at their S1 filed last Sept when they only had 176 employees provides some pretty shocking details:  At time of filing, burn was $7.4M in Sept alone, and a total of $39M in 6 months ($28M for ops, rest in investments/acquisitions). If you assume they could hold it to $7M despite growing headcount almost 70% they'd have burned another $50M since the filing and should run out by mid 2002. If it grew only 35% to $10M then expect them to be out of cash this coming Spring.\nOf course, this actually assumes they hit the necessary milestones as set out by the VCs!\nWhich brings us to the second major issue: their funding level. The $200M in the bank claim  is a fallacy.  Brience has to go to the well every month to get money.  The VCs must approve every month's capital outlay - and they could refuse at any time.  The VCs who originally signed up, lead by GTCR, never expected to have to invest the full $200M - once they IPOed, they'd be getting public  venture financing  (they disclose as much in S1).\nGiven the tight funding climate today, its no surprise analysts like  Seamus McAteer from Jupiter thinks they are going to go out of business.\nAmitabh also mentioned that many of the competitors that are coming to us and asking us to acquire them also went to Brience and found out that Brience is more of a SI than a product company (their thick client app for Ingram Micro is a good example).  These companies immediately turned away because they want to be a part of a product company.\nTo wit, Sales Team, if you're asked about Brience:\n1.  They are unstable with funding and there is a good chance that they will not be around much longer.  The $200M credit line hurts them because the well can be cut off at any time they're burning cash like its going out of style, the VCs put money in expecting a quick (that's not marketing spin -the language of agreement says they'd stop funding at IPO and of course they tried to flip within 6 months of start) and to date there is very little to show for it.\n2.  They are a professional services company, not a product company.\n3.  They do not have any signficant traction with customers or partners.\nRon", "output": "Brience - Organizations, Brience - Organizations, Seamus McAteer - Person Name, Jupiter - Organizations, Amitabh - Person Name, Brience - Organizations, Brience - Person Name"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "I talked to one of their networking guy Scott Gabbar, and he told me that they really don't like the idea of opening any inbound ports.

WebTV Networks estimates that there are currently\nover one million WebTV subscribers spending nearly 40 hours per month online --\n70 percent more time than their PC counterparts. Given that WebTV is but one of\nseveral Web-based TV platforms currently available, it is clear that we are\ndealing with an audience that is routinely underserved from a usability\nstandpoint and that means an inevitable, negative impact to ROI. \nAvocadoIT, Your Business Everywhere!\n**********************************************\nRon Silverton\nDirector, AvocadoITOnline\nAvocadoIT, Inc.\n2211 N.

Yes, but what does  mutually respectful  mean in this\ncontext?  Ask the Baptist missionaries currently held in Afghanistan.  Name\none Muslim country where LDS missionaries could teach for one day without\nbeing imprisoned.  The Church was merely acting in an inspired attempt to\navoid having Temple Square targeted for car bombs during the Olympics.\nDon't confuse that with the need to inform yourself at the individual level.\n 'In laying blame on an entire people, we undermine our nation's core values\nof equality and respect for the individual.'   Wrong.  People have a duty to\npolice their own, to cooperate in ferreting out evil-doers rather than\nharboring them.  Mormons have a responsibility to disavow people who commit\ncrimes in the name of Mormonism, and to hand over such people for\npunishment, and we do that.  So do most people of other faiths.  Sincere\nMuslim Americans can do what Japanese Americans did in WWII--prove their\npatriotism by proactively supporting the war effort and offering their\nlinguistic skills.  Why haven't we seen the ADL mounting a public campaign\nlike this, if they really believe what they say?\n 'Those responsible for the reprehensible actions of Sept. 11 in no way\nrepresent the views of millions of Muslims throughout the world'   The\nnewspaper articles below suggest otherwise.  Happy talk, censored press\naccounts and PC brow-beating is no substitute for the truth.\n 'The church urges its members and people everywhere to extend kindness and\nlove to all sons and daughter of God.'   Always a good idea.  At the same\ntime, we are not required to deny or ignore difficult realities.\n**********************************************************************\nTuesday September 11 4:04 PM ET\nArab Street Cheers, Govts Lament U.S. Attacks\nBy Joseph Logan\nBEIRUT (Reuters) - Arab leaders voiced shock and horror at devastating\nattacks that leveled symbols of American power on Tuesday, but a chorus of\ncheers rose from streets that resent U.S. backing of Israel.\nEgyptian President Hosni Mubarak (news - web sites), Washington's key Arab\nally, called the plane attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center and\nleft the Pentagon (news - web sites) in flames ``horrific beyond\nimagination.''  Ordinary Egyptians, however, felt otherwise.\n``Do you want to hear my honest opinion?'' asked Samira Mohamed, a\n26-year-old lawyer.  ``I was very happy when I heard the news. My happiness\nis based on my utter rejection of the U.S. treatment of the Middle East\ncase.''\nThe jubilation was echoed in other countries with large Palestinian\npopulations, where sentiment has crystallized against the United States over\nthe course of an 11-month Palestinian uprising against Israel.\nWhile Jordan's King Abdullah called the attacks ``terrorist actions that\ncontradict all...values,'' Jordanians and Palestinian refugees in Amman took\nto the streets in joy, some handing out sweets to celebrate.\nSYRIA CONDEMNS, IRAQ, HIZBOLLAH SILENT\nSyria, which has tense relations with the United States, strongly condemned\nthe attacks.\n``Syria condemns the sabotage destructive attacks which were directed\nagainst innocent civilians in the United States,'' a Syrian information\nofficial said.\n``Syria expresses its sympathy with the American people and families of the\nvictims who fell as a result of these attacks.''\nIraq, at war with Washington, had no reaction.\nThe Islamist Hizbollah guerrilla group, which in the past carried out\nsuicide bomb attacks against U.S targets in Lebanon, declined comment on\nTuesday's attacks.\nIn Beirut, Lebanese citizens and Palestinian refugees said the attack was\npayback for U.S. policies in the region, chief among them its backing for\nthe Jewish state that launched a bloody invasion of Lebanon in 1982.\n``We're ecstatic. Let America have a taste of what we've tasted,'' said Ali\nMareh, a Lebanese resident of Beirut.\nLebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri was quick to offer condolences to\nPresident Bush (news - web sites).\n``These tragic actions contradict all human and religious values,'' Hariri\nsaid in a statement.\nPalestinian President Yasser Arafat (news - web sites) condemned the\nattacks, but celebratory gunfire echoed across the West Bank, when\ntelevision stations showed footage of New York buildings on fire and\ncollapsing and terrified Americans fleeing the carnage.\nPalestinian refugees in Lebanon greeted news of the devastating attacks with\njubilant gunfire,  dancing and cheering, saying Israel's chief backer\ndeserved such a punishment.\n``This is the result of American policy. America and Israel are one,'' one\nPalestinian gunman said.\n``This is the reaction required to confront the American and Israeli\narrogance,'' said Mohamad Hallak, a 40-year-old Palestinian refugee from the\nRashidiyeh camp in Tyre.\nSHARED JOY\nSome Lebanese shared the joy.\n``People are happy. America has always supported terrorism. They see how the\ninnocent Palestinian children are killed and they back the Zionist army that\ndoes it. America has never been on the side of justice,'' said Samir, a\nLebanese.\n``This is the language that the United States understands and this is the\nway to stop America from helping the Zionist terrorists who are killing our\nchildren, men and women every day,'' said Palestinian Mohamed Rasheed.\nLebanon is home to some 360,000 Palestinian refugees. After four generations\nof exile, many feel embittered against the United States for its support of\nIsrael -- a feeling which has grown during the present uprising in the\noccupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza.\nPalestinians who have often burned U.S. flags in protests during their\n11-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation also celebrated in Arab\nEast Jerusalem.\n``I feel I am in a dream. I never believed that one day the United States\nwould come to pay a price for its support to Israel,'' said Mustafa, a\n24-year-old Palestinian gunman.\nSeveral dozen Palestinian youths gathered in East Jerusalem to celebrate,\nhonking out wedding tunes on their car horns.\n``We are so happy that America was hit. America is against us in supporting\nIsrael,''\nSuleiman, one of the demonstrators, said.\nIn Nablus, motorists honked horns and gunmen fired into the air to cheer the\nattacks which unfolded within a few hours and stunned people around the\nglobe.\nIsrael and the Palestinians have been locked in fighting since the\nPalestinian uprising against occupation erupted last September after peace\ntalks stalled.\nReaction was mixed elsewhere in Lebanon. Many people, used to wars,\nbombardment and destruction of their cities, watched the news in disbelief\nand shock.\n``Who could believe this is happening in the capitals of the world's only\nsuperpower?,'' said one Beirut resident.\n********************************************************************\nPalestinian Officials Quash Pictures of Arab Celebrations\nSept 13, 2001 Fox News\nby Catherine Donaldson-Evans\nThe Palestinian Authority has warned journalists they might be in danger if\nthey continue to use images of Arabs celebrating Tuesday's terrorist\nattacks.\nPA officials allegedly have threatened journalists who continue to show\nPalestinians rejoicing and dancing at the news of the devastation caused by\nhijacked jets in New York City, Washington and Pennsylvania.\nThe Foreign Press Association of Israel said the PA sent\narmed police to block camera crews from photographing Tuesday's rally in the\nWest Bank town of Nablus -- where thousands filled the streets to celebrate.\nIn addition, PA officials have reportedly phoned TV\nstations and other media to caution them their safety would be in jeopardy\nif they aired the segments.\nOfficially, Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat\ncondemned the hijackings that demolished the World Trade towers in New York,\ndamaged the Pentagon in Washington and claimed thousands of victims. Arafat\npublicly criticized Tuesday's acts of terrorism soon after word of the Arab\ncelebrations leaked.\nThe images of exuberant, cheering Palestinians \u2013 some of\nthem children and teens \u2013 when they heard news of the tragedies angered and\nhorrified people worldwide.\nAs early as Tuesday afternoon, TV stations everywhere were\nbroadcasting footage of revelers in the streets of Jerusalem and Nablus, in\nrefugee camps and in coffee shops. Some joyously fired rifles in the air,\nlaughed, handed out sodas and candy and  made signs of victory with their\nfingers.\nMost American networks, including Fox News Channel, aired\nthe images.\nIn addition, many newspapers, magazines, Web sites and wire\nservices ran photographs of the festivities.\nThe Associated Press would not confirm reports that it had\nstopped broadcasting film of the celebrations.  I have nothing to say about\nthis matter at this time,  AP Israel Bureau Chief Dan Perry told The\nJerusalem Post.\nBut one foreign correspondent told the Post that AP\nproducers had been threatened by PA Cabinet Secretary Abdel Ahmed Rahman,\nwho told them their safety couldn't be guaranteed if they insisted on\nbroadcasting the images.\nCharacterizing the threats against such footage and photos\nas  censorship,  the Foreign Press Association of Israel released a\nstatement expressing its  deep concern over the harassment of journalists by\nthe Palestinian Authority. \n We strongly condemn the direct threats made against local\nvideographers by local militia members and the attitude of Palestinian\nofficials who made no effort to counter the threats, control the situation\nor guarantee the safety of the journalists and the freedom of the press, \nthe FPA said.\nThe FPA also said it holds the Palestinian Authority fully\nresponsible for the safety of journalists working in areas under its\njurisdiction.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\nThis message was posted through the lds-chat@lists.stanford.edu email list.\nTo unsubscribe, email majordomo@lists.stanford.edu with the message\n unsubscribe lds-chat .

These guys are analysts, not Sales folks - however, I think the point we haven't really talked about much is finding the common enemy - like a competitor.\nDo you have any suggestions on how to sell CRM inside the organization?\nA: Yes, but they're really more than suggestions. They are closer to be being business rules.\nRule One: There is no silver bullet.\nRule Two: Look for friends in odd places. CRM is a business strategy that often has multiple parts of the organization touching it. Consequently, all those parts must pull together to maximize the effectiveness of the CRM initiatives.\nRule Three: Build CRM justification to management brick by brick.\nRule Four: Look for the major  pain points.  Most enterprises already know the weak points of their CRM efforts. Selling the plan will be easier if the sales efforts are concentrated on the pain points.\nRule Five: Have management become a customer.\nRule Six: Think strategically, but invest tactically. Don't try to accomplish all of CRM in one initiative, but you must know where you're headed. That way you can invest for specific, near-term results and still work effectively toward the long-run strategy.\nRule Seven: Find an enemy. Enterprises always work better if they can band together around a common enemy. So look at what the competition is doing in the CRM arena and use that as justification for many of these initiatives.\nRule Eight: Involve your customers every step of the way.\nYour Business  Everywhere\n***********************************************\nRon Silverton\nDirector of Strategic Marketing\nAvocadoIT, Inc\n2211 N First Street, Suite 200\nSan Jose CA, 95131\nw 408.562-8039\nm 415.845-6789\nf 408.5622-8100\nwww.avocadoit.com\n*************************************************", "output": "Gartner - Organizations, Ron Silverton - Person Name, AvocadoIT, Inc\n2211 N First Street, Suite 200\nSan Jose CA, 95131 - Address, w 408.562-8039\nm 415.845-6789\nf 408.5622-8100 - Phone Number, www.avocadoit.com - Email"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "Interesting developments.

The company has staged a tremendous turn-around in the past two years, going from Barron\u2019s infamous burn-rate list to profitability last quarter.  The company turned a profit in Q1 2002, and shares currently trade at 11-times projected 2002 earnings (conservative).  With $8 million in the bank and a market cap below $50 million, Growth Report views this company as an excellent opportunity for investors interested in jumping on a micro cap opportunity.\nTo submit your answers, complete this form http://www.bizfn.com/?SN=GR2002071845 or simply e-mail your answer to editor@growthreport.com with your name, phone number, and mailing address.  Winners will be notified and announced next week.\nAnother Day In Paradise\u2026\nNews was out Tuesday from brokerage firm Adams, Harkness, and Hill, when the investment firm announced that analyst Steve Frankel initiated coverage of Sonic Solutions ( NASDAQ: SNIC) with a Buy Rating and a price target of $11 based on a PE of 25 on calendar year 2003 EPS of $0.43.  According to the firm, this is still based on a discount to the company\u2019s 35% growth rate.  In the research report, Frankel goes on to say that Sonic is in the booming market of DVD-RW drives, and expects the market to grow from 500,000 in 2001 to more than 50 million by 2005.  Other good news according to Frankel includes that the company is profitable and should earn $0.25 in 2003 followed by $0.46 in 2004.  Click here for the research report.\nWe\u2019ve always loved Sonic.  We told Growth Report subscribers to buy shares at $4.09 on Dec. 20, 2001 and haven\u2019t looked back.  We also love it when the investment banks / research firms substantiate our findings in their own research reports months later and after nearly a 100% price appreciation.  But hey, that\u2019s exactly why you\u2019re willing to pay the big bucks subscribing to Growth Report.  Our take is the more coverage for Sonic, the better.\nOptions for JetBlue\u2026\nThe Pacific Exchange (PCX) announced Monday that it will begin trading options in JetBlue ( NASDAQ: JBLU; PCX: BJO).  Not huge news, but thought you should know.  By the way, you heavy hitters may not be able to take full advantage \u2013 options will trade on the February expiration cycle with an exercise limit of 22,500 contracts.\nRussell Up Some Profits\u2026\nj2 Global Communications ( NASDAQ: JCOM) last week reported that it has been added to the Russell 3000 and Russell 2000 financial indices, effective July 1, 20002.  President Scott Jarus commented, \u201cj2 Global's inclusion in these indices is a reflection of the impact our continued revenue and earnings growth have had on our market capitalization.\u201d\nGrowth Report likes the j2 Global story and the stock\u2019s performance.  As we all know, inclusion in indices such as the Russell result in additional buying pressure and re-balancing by funds that own a given index.  The company will be announcing Q2 2002 earnings next Monday, July 22, and you can bet we will be sitting on the sidelines awaiting those results.  With shares of j2 trading at $15.99, Growth Report is up some 47% since initiating coverage on April 29, 2002 at $10.85.\nShould We Stay, or Should We Go\u2026\nIn a column by contributing writer Bill Martin on July 1 titled \u201c Online Commerce Finds Its Groove\u201d, we mentioned InfoSpace ( NASDAQ: INSP) as a stock to watch.  Shares closed at $0.52 on July 1 after being booted from the Russell 2000 index.\nSine being kicked off the Russell due to annual re-balancing activities, InfoSpace has seen shares fall as low as $0.37.  The company has since re-affirmed Q2 earnings expectations, reporting that it will meet or beat previous guidance.\nThe company also faces possible de-listing from NASDAQ due to a bid price deficiency.  NASDAQ requires that all listed companies maintain a minimum share price of $1.  In order to again become compliant with the exchange\u2019s requirements, InfoSpace needs to maintain a stock price above $1 for 10 consecutive trading sessions.\nWhile Growth Report is concerned with the potential NASDAQ de-listing, we have our fingers crossed that with strong Q2 earnings InfoSpace will be able to make the move from $0.67 to above $1 to come in compliance with NASDAQ share price requirements.  We are pleased to see strength in the company\u2019s stock since the beginning of July, with shares trading up some 28% since adding InfoSpace to our watch-list on July 1.\nSuper Stages Comeback\u2026\nSuperGen ( NASDAQ: SUPG) has staged quite the impressive comeback from mid-May, with shares rebounding from a 52-week low of $4.05 to today\u2019s $6.40.  Not a bad little run \u2013 think we\u2019ll dub SuperGen the \u201cComeback Kid.\u201d\nThe company has been pretty quiet as of late, although last week did announce that researchers at University of Texas have demonstrated in an animal model that a new fusion protein that links vascular endothelial growth factor with a toxin will target and destroy the blood vessels supplying the tumor.  SuperGen licensed the vascular endothelial growth factor from Peregrine Pharmaceuticals ( NASDAQ: PPHM) in February 2001.\nOut With The Old, Make Room For The New\u2026\nWe decided to do some summer housecleaning by kicking out some of the under-performers from the Growth Report Portfolio to make room for some new opportunities come fall.\nCeco Environmental ( NASDAQ: CECE):  We had a nice ride from $3.25 to $4.60 (41% return), but with the stock in a steady decline since the start of May, we\u2019ve decided we\u2019re out and will close the position.  With negative revenue growth, a declining stock price and no news on the horizon this one has turned into a real sleeper.\nSonicBlue ( NASDAQ: SBLU):  Again, a great performer for the Growth Report Portfolio in the past.  The company remains the top performer in terms of maximum percentage return of 322% (in on November 7 at $1.30 \u2013 subsequent high of $5.49).  Now trading under a buck and facing NASDAQ de-listing, we\u2019re going to let this one go.\nAngiotech ( NASDAQ: ANPI):  Chart makes this stock look like a falling knife.  We\u2019re not gonna try to catch it.  We\u2019ll close our position on this one \u2013 the stock has fallen from $47 to $35.  What can we say \u2013 biotech is not the most popular sector of the market these days.\nA New Policy\u2026\nInitially when we launched Growth Report, our primary focus was to provide high quality stock investment ideas on the buy-side.  That is, to be a source of ideas for our subscribers, allowing you to decide when to enter or exit a given position.  We realize this may have been confusing in the past as we would recommend stocks with a \u201cbuy\u201d rating, but would rarely issue a \u201csell\u201d alert once the stock had significant gains.  As a result, it seems some of our subscribers hung onto top performers (such as SonicBlue when it was up some 300%+).\nWe will be taking a new approach to investment picks by actively watching previously recommended issues and will instruct subscribers as to when we believe they may want to consider taking the money off the table, both when stocks move to the upside or downside.\nWe hope this will make our subscription service more useful to you in your investing and trading.

Bill Clinton.\nThe two men had a contentious meeting in their final days in the White House, two Democrats close to the former president and vice president told Fox News.\nAccounts of the meeting first appeared in The Washington Post.\nGore essentially told Clinton he believes he lost the contested election because of the former president's sex scandal with a White House intern, the sources told Fox News. Gore told Clinton the scandal was harmful to the country and disastrous for his campaign, the Democrats said.\nClinton told the two sources he was taken aback by Gore's comments and responded by telling the vice president that he failed to promote the administration's achievements on education and the economy.\nThe meeting between the two lasted more than an hour and was described as being heated at times with very direct language exchanged between both men.\nGore, now a visiting professor at Columbia University in New York, reportedly sought the unscheduled one-on-one meeting with Clinton, which lasted over an hour and was described by a Gore aide as  cathartic.  A Clinton adviser's characterization was  tense. \nThe pair's election post-mortem centered around the question that hung over the vice president's campaign from its inception: When it came to associating himself with Clinton, how close was too close?\nDemocrats are still squabbling over how much Clinton had to do with Gore's loss. Gore consultant Carter Eskew claimed the Monica Lewinsky scandal was  the elephant in the living room  that hindered Gore's efforts. But a White House official retorted in the Post report,  I don't think the fact that they lost four out of four debates had anything to do with Bill Clinton. \nIn the days following their post-election face-off, Clinton and Gore had a number of polite encounters both in person and on the phone. Though some interpreted the meeting as unpleasant, others reportedly saw it as a necessary air-clearing.\n\u2014 Fox News' Rita Cosby contributed to this report", "output": "Wed, 7 Feb 2001 - Date,  <George.Richard@avocadoit.com> - Email, Wed, 7 Feb 2001 - Date, Wed, 7 Feb 2001 - Date, http://www.foxnews.com/images/service_foxnews_36.gif - URL, http://www.foxnews.com/politics/020701/images/clinton_gore1.jpg - URL, Wednesday, February 7, 2001 - Date, FOXNews.com - Organizations, Al Gore - Person Name, Clinton - Person Name, Al Gore - Person Name, Bill Clinton - Person Name, Bill Clinton. - Person Name, White House - Location, The Washington Post. - Organizations, Gore - Person Name, Clinton - Person Name, Gore - Person Name, Clinton - Person Name, Clinton - Person Name, Gore's  - Person Name, Gore - Person Name, Clinton - Person Name, Gore  - Person Name, Clinton  - Person Name, Clinton - Person Name, Clinton - Person Name, Gore's  - Person Name, Carter Eskew - Person Name, Monica Lewinsky - Person Name, Clinton - Person Name, Gore - Person Name, Rita Cosby  - Person Name"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "What's the story behind this?

Now, we\u2019re back to following him like sheep.  Somewhere in the middle lies a good bet.\nBuffett has been active lately; smart traders are like that.  They sell to you in bull markets when they\u2019re taking profits and you\u2019re aiming for the sky.  Then buy from you in bear markets when you\u2019re covering losses and they\u2019re investing for the long term.\nThe thing to remember is that the game is different for Warren Buffett than for you or I.  Besides having deep pockets and time on his side, not to mention the leverage of his branded last name, his terms when it comes to buying stock are far better than just the purchase of everyday common shares.  He can afford to take seemingly riskier bets in bear markets because he often gets collateral to back up his investments.  Which probably makes it better to invest with him in Berkshire Hathaway ( NYSE: BRKa; NYSE: BRKb) rather than alongside him by buying shares in the actual companies he\u2019s targeted: Level 3 Communications ( Nasdaq: LVLT) and Williams Cos. ( NYSE: WMB).\nIn this week\u2019s Growth Report we will be taking a detailed look at Level 3 Communications and the investment opportunities it represents.  The dilemma, some might say, is that while anything Buffett touches seems to turn to gold (probably why the stock shot up over 300 percent on news of his interest), the reality of Level 3 as a standalone investment opportunity remains delicately fragile.\nEven Standard and Poor\u2019s has its doubts, downgrading Level 3\u2019s credit rating to CCC from CCC+ given the company\u2019s still heavy debt obligations amid poor demand for data-transport services.  S&P\u2019s reality check stands opposite the halo effect Buffett creates even around the most beaten down companies.  The nuances of each side \u2013 Buffett\u2019s investment versus Level 3\u2019s underlying fundamentals -- are important to understand such that investors might make their own reasoned decisions.\nIf you\u2019re Warren Buffett and you\u2019re investing in Level 3, life is grand.  The $100 million Berkshire Hathaway bought in convertible debt is a drop in the bucket for the world\u2019s seventh richest man and the $80 billion investment conglomerate he heads.  Moreover, he is in the enviable position of getting his money back with interest or likely converting to common shares at a discount.  The average investor, on the other hand, must buy common shares at the market price and face the prospect that the telecom industry will not turn for some time while Wall Street also loosens its analyst support for the company.\nBearish factors affecting Level 3 include weak demand for the company\u2019s services due to excess capacity in the industry and potentially increased competition from other service providers that may, eventually, emerge from bankruptcy.  Still Buffett has shown that he has more than magic fairy dust when it comes to finding undervalued opportunities.\nAlthough some are questioning his wisdom in investing in energy and telecom at a time when each, telecom in particular, are at such historic financial and emotional lows, Mr. Buffett has shown time and again an uncanny ability to pick rubble from the heap and make it shine.\nHe did it previously with Geico, American Express ( NYSE: AXP), and even Coca-Cola ( NYSE: KO) when he started acquiring shares in the mid-1970s, investments that have proven to be enormously profitable for Buffett and his Berkshire Hathaway shareholders.  There is, however, a difference between simply buying stock in companies like Williams Cos. and Level 3, and buying stock \u2013 or convertible debt \u2013 as Buffett is able to do.\nFor Buffett, it\u2019s an easy decision to offer a $900 million secured credit to Williams \u2013 in this case alongside Lehman Brothers \u2013 because in return he gets collateral worth a large chunk of $2.6 billion in real assets. (Williams bought Barrett Resources last year for $2.6 billion and virtually all of its oil and gas interests were posted as collateral.)  These assets certainly would not be paid out to the average investor in the event of a business failure.\nThe issue, of course, is a double-edged sword.  We loathe financiers who receive special terms for \u201crescuing\u201d a company short of cash.  Yet, as investors, we would rather have these companies stay afloat regardless of the cost.  Warren Buffett -- his own firm\u2019s book value up several points this year as opposed to the S&P 500 which is down 15-20 percent \u2013 gets to enjoy both.  Yet, investors should know that Buffett routinely requests to seal portions of quarterly filings for some of his companies.\nThen again, he\u2019s Warren Buffett and we\u2019re not.  Something to remember the next time you want to piggyback the Oracle of Omaha Buffett before the finer points of the deal are revealed.\nSubscribe NOW...\nIn order to stay abreast of all Portfolio changes and alerts, new stock and sector picks, and to receive the Print Version of Growth Report, please register for a FREE trial to the PREMIUM Growth Report Newsletter by following this link:    http://www.growthreport.com/register.asp\nHappy Investing,\nPeter Henig\nContributing Editor\nGrowth Report\nWe appreciate your feedback!

The autobiographical John Lennon song, which appeared on the 1965 album  Rubber Soul,  beat the Rolling Stones'  Satisfaction  to lead the list, which was compiled from Top 10 lists submitted by 20 famous songwriters, including Paul McCartney, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, legendary '50s lyricist Jerry Leiber and Burt Bacharach collaborator Hal David. Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg's  Over The Rainbow,  from  The Wizard of Oz,  was third. The Beatles had two songs on the list, compiled for the British music magazine Mojo. The full list, with the artists who made then famous:\n1 - IN MY LIFE - The Beatles.\n2 - (I CAN'T GET NO) SATISFACTION - The Rolling Stones.\n3 - OVER THE RAINBOW - Judy Garland.\n4 - HERE, THERE AND EVERYWHERE - The Beatles.\n5 - TRACKS OF MY TEARS - Smokey Robinson and the Miracles.\n6 - THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN' - Bob Dylan.\n7 - STRANGE FRUIT - Billie Holiday.\n8 - I CAN'T MAKE YOU LOVE ME - Bonnie Raitt.\n9 - PEOPLE GET READY - The Impressions.\n10 - YOU'VE LOST THAT LOVIN' FEELIN' - The Righteous Brothers.\nReturn to Top\nArtists take piracy issued to press\nNEW YORK (Billboard) - The Artists Against Piracy kicked off its education campaign Tuesday with full-page ads in the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, USA Today, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post. Bearing the headline  If a Song Means a Lot To You, Imagine What It Means To Us,  the ad lists 68 artists who support intellectual property rights. The ad appears as Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich, Byrds co-founder Roger McGuinn and others were in Washington, to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about music on the Internet and how it affects intellectual property rights. On the opposite side of the argument, Napster CEO Hank Barry is also appearing before the Committee.  Our mission is to provide a collective voice for artists on the issue of the digital distribution of music,  explained AAP leader Noah Stone.\n The advancements in technology have created exciting opportunities for artists online, but we believe artists ought to have the right to choose how and if their work is distributed on the Internet,  added Stone.  The issue of compensation for and creative control by artists is important to all of us because it affects our careers, our livelihoods and our futures.  AAP has found support from a wide ranging group of artists, including Alanis Morissette, Everclear's Art Alexakis, Barenaked Ladies, Blink 182, Bon Jovi, Bryan Adams, Christina Aguilera, DMX, Faith Hill, Filter, Garth Brooks, Hanson, Sarah McLachlan, Sisqo, Vertical Horizon and others.\nReturn to Top\nJeweler sues Michael Jackson\nSANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) - A Beverly Hills jewelry store is suing Michael Jackson for more than $1.4 million, claiming he agreed to buy a rare diamond watch, used it for nearly four months without paying for it, then returned it damaged. The lawsuit claims that Jackson made a verbal agreement in December with Rodeo Drive retailer David Orgell to purchase the King Kalla Vacheron Constantine watch originally valued at $1.9 million, reduced by $450,000 through bartering. The suit, filed Monday in Los Angeles County Superior Court in Santa Monica, also seeks $15,000 owed on other items purchased at the store this year.\nJackson spokesman Howard Rubenstein said in a statement Tuesday that the singer never made a final decision to purchase the watch.  Employees of David Orgell delivered the watch to Mr. Jackson for his approval,  the statement said.  Those same employees engaged in repeated conversations in which they were advised that a final decision had not been made.  Ali Soltani, vice president of David Orgell, said that Jackson returned the watch with scratches and unknown particles between the diamonds.\nReturn to Top\nNapster hires away music executive\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Napster announced Wednesday it has hired a former high-ranking music industry executive to help lead the troubled song-swapping software company into the future. Keith Bernstein, 34, will serve as Napster's vice president of operations beginning July 17. Bernstein formerly worked at Universal Music Group, where he was senior director of operations and helped steer the company's digital music download program. Bernstein worked to ensure that Universal artists' rights and royalties would be maintained throughout the music download process. Without secure technology, digitally formatted music can be endlessly duplicated without loss of quality, such as with the popular MP3 format.

Lisa\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nIslamic Terrorism (final in the series on Islamic issues)\nWilliam J. Hamblin and Daniel C. Peterson\n[LDSWorld-Gems is pleased to share this weekly column written by scholars\nassociated with the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies\n(FARMS) at BYU. This weekly column will present thought-provoking essays\non religious questions and topics.   See http://www.farmsresearch.com\nSee archive of recent columns at http://www.ldsworld.com/gems/farms ]\nIn the wake of the tragic events in New York and Washington, there has\nbeen a great deal in the news about Islam and Islamic extremism.  We hope\nit has provided some much needed education for many Americans to whom\nIslam is often a little understood mystery.  This essay will not examine\nthe specific religious beliefs of Usama bin Ladin, on which neither of us\nis an expert.  Rather, we will attempt to explain the basic religious\nworldview that underlies many Islamic extremist movements, a worldview\nthat is probably largely shared by Usama and his followers.\nThe primary goal of Islamic extremists is to free all Muslims from foreign\ndomination.  For Islamists, the modern political boundaries of the Middle\nEast are arbitrary lines set up by European colonial powers in a ploy to\nfacilitate their domination of the region.  Islamists seek a single\nunified Islamic state -- paralleling the illustrious Islamic caliphate\nthat was the greatest empire in the world in the eighth century.  If all\nMuslims could only unite, they believe, they would form a world power that\nwould rival the United States.  From Usama's perspective, struggles\nagainst the Russians in Afghanistan, the Israelis in Palestine, or\nAmerican troops based in Saudi Arabia are all one: It is a fight to free\nMuslims from the colonialism or imperialism under which they have suffered\nfor nearly two centuries, and, thereby, to unify the Islamic world.\nFrom the extremist perspective, the continual presence of US troops in\nSaudi Arabia since the Gulf War in 1991 is particularly infuriating.\nArabia is the holy land of Muhammad, who taught that Arabia and the sacred\nKa'aba (the Muslim temple at Mecca) must be a sacred land reserved solely\nfor Muslims.  From the US perspective, by contrast, our troops are\nstationed in Saudi Arabia at the request of the country's legitimate\ngovernment, to protect the Saudis.  We think we are helping.  From the\nIslamist perspective, however, the Saudi government is a hopelessly\ncorrupt puppet of the United States, which maintains its troops in the\nregion only to control the region's oil wealth for our exploitation.\nLikewise, Israel is seen as a foreign colonial power occupying Muslim\nland.  Without the support of US policies, arms, and money, the Islamists\nclaim, the Israelis would have been driven from Palestine years ago.\nAgain they see the US as oppressing Muslim people by supporting Israel.\nIf Israel is ever to be defeated, they maintain, the US must first be\nconvinced that the price we pay for supporting Israel is simply too high.\nIn conjunction with this, the Islamists often wonder why they should take\nUS opposition to terrorism seriously when American foreign policy tacitly\npermits Israeli assassinations, bombings, and the torture and massacre of\nMuslims -- many of whom are also innocent civilians, not unlike those who\ndied in connection with the four recent airline hijackings.\nUsama's world view is in many ways apocalyptic.  He believes that God will\ngrant victory to the Muslims if enough have the faith and courage to die\nfor their religion.  Usama has seen the success of terrorism and guerilla\nwarfare in the defeat suffered by the massive military power of the\nSoviets at the hands of Muslim warriors in Afghanistan.  Their victory in\nAfghanistan, they believe, laid the foundation of the collapse of the\nentire Soviet empire, thereby also freeing the Muslims of Azerbaijan,\nUzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan from\nRussian domination.  In other words, the tactics of Usama against the\nRussians -- which the US supported in Afghanistan -- not only defeated\nthem, but destroyed the Soviet Union.  This is viewed as a miraculous\nvictory from God.  And those same tactics are now being turned against the\nUS, with precisely the same goal in mind -- to drive foreign oppressors\nfrom the lands of Islam.  Usama believes that the US will eventually\ncollapse and fragment in precisely the same way the Soviet Union did.\nWe want to make it clear that we are not attempting to defend Islamic\nextremism, nor, for that matter, any other form of religious extremism.\nWe do, however, believe that we will not succeed in eliminating the\nproblem of Islamic terrorism simply by dropping bombs or imprisoning or\nexecuting the perpetrators of these horrendous crimes.  We must understand\nthe root causes of extremism and terrorism, and we must address those\nproblems with long-term solutions.  There will not be peace and stability\nin the Middle East until there is justice in the Middle East.  The major\nresponsibility for the resolution of these problems rests in the hands of\nthe Muslims of the Near East themselves.  We in American cannot solve\ntheir problems for them, but we must be willing to offer help whenever\npossible, and we must try, as much as we can, not to be an obstacle (even\ninadvertently) to reforms and improvements.\nThe policies the US government chooses to undertake in the effort to\neradicate terrorism may well be necessary in this world ruled by blood and\nhorror.  But our response as Christians is unambiguously taught by Christ:\n Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and\nhate thine enemy.  But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that\ncurse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which\ndespitefully use you, and persecute you; That ye may be the children of\nyour Father which is in heaven  (Matthew 5:43-45).  As difficult as it may\nbe at the moment to hear such teaching, Usama bin Ladin and his followers\nneed our prayers too.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nCopyright 2001, Millennial Star Network - distributed on the Internet\nvia the LDSWorld-Gems mailing list.

These are the two NT boxes that make up accenture and upshot (don't ask me which is which).  I don't think we need AE to test this since I just moved the disks over.  We just need to do a switch (tommorrow) and notify support, and give DNS some time to switch over by end of week.\nNOTE: the box that's on the table is DOA.  I found this out AFTER mounting it on the top (UGH).  threw my back out doing it too :}  (and if u were wondering steve, no I'm not coming in tommorrow anyways :} )\nWe'll have to get that repaired.  I don't remember my posts, but I think it was one long, three short which if memory serves me (haha, no pun intended), it's a memory issue.  The box won't even boot.  I'll look at it later on when we have the time.  If avocadoit / accenture happens, avocadoit can have that box *hehe*\nNetras:  put the two netras on top of jakarta.  predictive one is not mounted.  Tony's fucking .103 problem still exists and I can KICK myself for not fucking fixing it before I moved it.  The server loads up emas and netscape on bootup (/etc/rc3.d/S99ecs and S99nes).  the S99nes is what causes the problem.  Tony in his infinite wisdom, set it to automatically put the password into the https server.  BUT, what happens is after it gets to that point, input is no longer allowed on the console since the command prompt never comes back !!!! TONY!!!!!!!! ARGH\nanyways, since it's in this condition, I can't get to the box whatsoever without booting off of solaris cdrom and boot into rw safe mode and mount the disk and get rid of the script...  foo\nanyways, the aenetra one is up and I'll be working on setting fidelity up on that one first.  I'll have to make another trip to uunet to finish the other one though and bring the solaris CD with me.  Maybe tommorrow, maybe wednesday.  I set the IP's 10.8.4.110 and 10.8.4.111.  I have hooked both up to network and to the terminal console. (ports 10 and 11 I think)\nI got the small terminal console in my trunk.  I will bring that back to the office.  We can probably use it for something later.\nI took the two kvm's and most (if not all) of the kvm cables and brought them to uunet.  Will hook up later this week if not next depending on how much time I have.  With these two additionals, we should be OK for setting up the kvm's.  I would REALLY like to see the docs that come with these so I can configure the spanning correctly.\nI have gone through and totally yanked all the wiring in exodus that's not in use now.  It's all sitting in one ugly pile where the upshot box used to sit.  Need boxes to box it up and take to uunet/office.\nTommorrow I'll bring up the two NT boxes and continue working on the solaris box for fidelity transfer.  From my perspective, fidelity is the only thing left then to get up and running.  The go2 transfer can totally wait until we get time to deal with it now that we have some extra netras.\nAll we have left then is to wait until fidelity is finally moved over, secured behind the router with another subnet, and then configured properly and we should be good to go.  Once that's all done, we can get another truck and move the rest of the shit out of exodus and be done with them.\nFinal note:  we move out of exodus finally and what happens?  I see a major MAJOR hottie working in the noc and she's like talking me up like crazy.  Follows me to cage, chatty as hell.  fucking A, can't she see my wedding ring? :}  amit would have had a field day! :}  MAJOR hottie :}  dunno what a chick like that is doing in a noc...\n rm -Rf /bin/laden \nCraig", "output": "accenture and upshot - Organizations, steve - Person Name,  avocadoit / accenture - Organizations, Tony - Person Name, TONY!!!!!!!!

People generalize about XP from zero examples all the time. ;->\nHow many examples do you need?\nThink seriously about this: Jeffries thinks that the above code is\nduplication. What would duplication have to be for that to be true? Pick a\nlikely-seeming and simple hypothesis.\nOr I'd be happy to have you figure out your own meaning for  duplicate\ncode . It should have a reasonable relationship to the usual uses of the\nword duplicate, as in duplicate a document, duplicating work, duplicate\nrequirements, and any other uses of the word you come up with. Working with\nthat and observing what happened would be sufficient to teach you what Beck\n(and I) would like you to know about simple design.\n> > Part of the art is in observing duplication.\n>\n>I'm good at observing.\nExcellent. What do you observe about my example that might be considered\n duplication ?\n>That's not my problem, I don't think. I want to know\n>what is considered duplication, and what isn't.\nIf it's identical, it's duplication. If it is identical under substitution\nof symbols, it's duplication. If it does the same thing to the same data\nstructure, it's duplication. If it looks remotely similar, it might be\nduplication.\nThe dictionary says the following, which is pretty good: duplicate\n\\Du pli*cate\\, n. 1. That which exactly resembles or corresponds to\nsomething else; another, correspondent to the first; hence, a copy; a\ntranscript; a counterpart.\n> > I have seen Beck declare two\n> > sets of adjacent for loops to be duplicate in spite of the fact that the\n> > loops inside the sets didn't have the same indices -- one was\n> > short-terminated and the other was not. He undid the short termination,\n> > making them the same, removed the duplication, then found a way to put the\n> > short termination back in.\n>\n>Okay, what rule does he use to determine whether something is duplication?\nI really don't know. But it seems to have something to do with patches of\ncode that are alike in some important lexical or functional respect ... or\nat least that's what I've induced. And when I use that definition, it gives\nme code that I like.\n>Related question: does it depend on the language whether one can in fact\n>remove all duplication?\nI don't know. I don't even know if there is ANY language in which you are\nguaranteed to be able to remove all duplication. I'll deal with that\nproblem after I solve the one about  test everything that could possibly\nbreak .\n> > > > 3. Expresses all the ideas you want to express.\n> > > > 4.

It just isn't the answer\nyou expected.\n>I want to know which the rule says to\n>prefer: 120 classes with 1500 methods or 100 classes with 1600 methods.\nWhich one is more communicative? Which one reduces duplication more?\n(You are about to say what if they are equal in communication and lack of\nduplication. They won't be. See if you can find an example. Try for a\nsmaller number of classes and methods.)\n>(You are probably aware that one can trade off methods for classes and vice\n>versa)\nYes, I was vaguely aware of that. Is it possible to trade off methods for\nclasses and vice versa without impact on communication and duplication?\n> > Do those answers help?\n>\n>See above. I hope they have helped me clarify to you what I'm asking about\n>:-).\nYes, I believe that I understand exactly what you are asking.\nUnfortunately, my answer is: Write code, and try to make it meet these\nrules. Soon you will know the answer as well as anyone.\nThese are the rules for  The Simplest Code :\n1. Runs all the tests.\n2. Contains no duplicate code.\n3. Expresses every idea you want to express.\n4. Minimizes classes and methods.\nThere are no rules for  Simple Enough Code . That's a judgment call, based\non how simple the code needs to be and how hard it is getting to make it\nsimpler.\nMy advice is to apply these rules to make the code simpler. Pretty soon\nyou'll be a wizard at producing simple code. Maybe you'll even come up with\na better way to tell people how to do it. That'd be cool.\nHow are we doing?\nRon Jeffries\nwww.XProgramming.com\nThe practices are not the knowing.

Eager to expunge the dot-com taint -- the volatile stock\nvaluations based on questionable, pure-play Internet business models -- much\nof Silicon Alley is recasting itself in a wireless role.\nThere is even a new buzzword to describe the scene:  unstrung. \nThe unstrung are undaunted by some experts' gloomy forecasts that the\nwireless Internet might never live up to its billing if users are turned off\nby the current, bland offerings of e-mail or sports scores, served up as\nscanty lines of text on the tiny screens of cellular phones and other mobile\ndevices.\nUndeterred, more than two dozen New York wireless Internet companies have\nbeen created in the last year or so. The rookie lineup includes Savos, which\ndelivers Internet music and other Web-based audio to mobile phones;\nSmartRay, a portal seeking to be the wireless Yahoo, and Upoc, which focuses\non Internet text-messaging services intended for young wireless phone\nenthusiasts.\nThe West Coast remains the locus of wireless technology development. And\nthere are many more wireless Internet services and applications already up\nand running in Europe -- eagerly embraced by people weary of balky wired\ntelephone networks. But it is New York that has become the fertile breeding\nground for new uses and services through wireless hand-held devices.\nPart of the impetus is geographic.  Manhattan has the potential to be the\ncenter of deals between the U.S. and Europe, where the wireless phenomenon\nis much stronger,  said Mark Caron, chief executive of MobileSpring, a\nso-called incubator company in New York that is focused on wireless\nstart-ups. What's more, he said,  the level of creativity here is\nunequaled. \nAnd then, of course, there is New York's standing as a major money center. A\nhost of financiers with operations in New York are focusing on the wireless\nInternet, with big players including Flatiron Partners, a venture capital\nfirm that has had ties with Chase Manhattan and Softbank of Japan. Others,\nlike Nokia Venture Partners, the investment arm of the Finnish mobile phone\ngiant Nokia, are preparing to set up New York offices.\n New York is getting hot very quickly,  said Tom Kenney, a principal at\nNokia Venture Partners, who plans to move the firm's East Coast base to New\nYork from Washington.\nThe field is so new and so much in flux that no one pretends to have firm\nfigures on investments, jobs created or even the number of new wireless\nInternet companies in New York. But many with money agree that the mobile\nInternet is one of the few Net-related areas that continues to solicit\nstrong interest among entrepreneurs and investors.\n We were among the first to carve out a space in the area,  said Seth\nGoldstein of Flatiron Partners.\nThe New York wireless scene is buzzing, so much so that an online magazine\nhas been created to cover it all: the magazine, Unstrung, seeks to blend the\nsophistication of Wallpaper, an architecture and design magazine, with the\nattention to detail of trade publications like Wireless Week. Unstrung's\nmotto is  tied to nothing but the future. \n We're on the cusp where the kids in sandals at the dot-coms are turning\ntheir attention to wireless,  said Josh Newman, a former schoolteacher in\nthe South Bronx, who help found Unstrung and serves as its top editor.  The\nopportunity to cover this potentially huge niche was looking us right in the\nface. \nStoking Mr. Newman's hope that Unstrung can hit it big was a panel\ndiscussion about the wireless Internet last month held by the New York New\nMedia Association at N.Y.U. The event's organizers had to turn away about\n200 people after the crowd reached the fire marshal's limit of 1,100.\nMany were employees at Silicon Alley dot-coms who were hoping to learn more\nabout what was being touted as the next big thing. A good many others were\nfrom other walks of life -- just curious about a subject that true believers\ndiscuss with equal parts grandeur and jargon. ( Talk spurt  and\n location-based services  are two favorites in the unstrung lexicon.)\nSome people in New York's wireless Internet scene, think that the buzz\nsurrounding the young industry -- including the verbiage -- is risky.\n We're concerned that the hype level, combined with the lack of knowledge\nabout the limitations of the wireless Internet, could turn people off in the\nsame way pure Internet plays are falling out of favor,  said Brian Bodell,\nhead of marketing strategies at Mobile Metrics, a company providing\nadvertising services for wireless users.  That's why you rarely see a\nwireless Internet company with a dot-com in their name and why many\ncompanies want to show they're not betting all their chips on wireless. \nBut certainly some established Silicon Alley Web development companies see\nadvantages in having a stake in wireless. For instance, Razorfish and\nAgency.com, two players with international reach that help companies develop\nand roll out their Web operations, are expanding their New York wireless\noperations.\n Until six or eight weeks ago, we had no concrete wireless plans for North\nAmerica  said David Eastman, Agency's head of mobile business for Europe,\nduring a recent trip to New York.  But now, we're ready to promote a\nknowledge bleed from London to New York because this is where the action\nis. \nAmong the pure-play mobile Internet start-ups, New York's best known so far\nmay be Vindigo, which provides maps and information from publications like\nthe Zagat restaurant guides, for use on Palm hand-helds and other portable\ndevices.\nThe service is not yet a true wireless Internet application, because users\nmust download the material through a standard, land-line Internet\nconnection. But the information is formatted for relatively easy searching\nand reading on a hand-held device, and the company plans to offer wireless\nupdating as network technology evolves.\nNearly 100,000 people have downloaded the company's city guides in six\nmonths in New York and four other urban regions, making Vindigo one of the\nfirst applications of its kind to show potential of spreading  virally  --\nby word of mouth, or mouse -- and with little formal advertising.\n We're creating the technology which will allow content providers to extend\ntheir brand to the wireless realm,  said Jason Devitt, 31, who left a job\nselling derivatives at D. E. Shaw, a technology-focused investment bank, to\nbecome Vindigo's chief executive last year.\n Look around,  Mr. Devitt said, pointing to the frenzied activity in\nVindigo's disheveled headquarters in a gutted building in the garment\ndistrict.  We have no time to pause and think about whether we're going to\nbe a big part of the location-based services segment because we're already\nthere. \nWhile Vindigo offers a glimpse of an industry poised for takeoff, most\nwireless Internet companies in New York are in the early stages of\ndevelopment --  stealth mode,  as people familiar with the start-ups put it.\nFew have advanced beyond the first stages of financing provided by venture\ncapitalists.\nStill, the sense that new applications can evolve well beyond stock quotes\nor short e-mail has some people believing that local companies have a bright\nfuture.\nTim Connolly, director of Ericsson CyberLab, a research and development\ncompany set up in New York's financial district by the Swedish\ntelecommunications giant Ericsson, said that  with the mobile Internet, it\nseems the transition from technology to services is happening faster than it\nhappened on the Web, and thus the services focus that New York has plays a\nlarge role. \nTo be sure, the advantage of being close to the television, publishing,\ntelecommunications and financial industries of New York is a lure for anyone\nseeking to hop on the wireless Internet bandwagon.\nBut given the industry's current limitations, there is a chance that\ncompanies focusing on applications for the wireless Internet might be in for\nthe rough road traveled by many a struggling content provider for the\nhard-wired Web.\nAfter all, there are two definitions of  unstrung  in the American Heritage\nConcise Dictionary. One is  having the strings loosened or removed.  The\nother is  emotionally upset.

(VENTUREWIRE) -- Ants.com, a developer of technology that keeps address books up to date and an operator of an online marketplace for freelancers, said it has acquired the rights to the customers of Zkey, an identity and personal information management company. Zkey, which is changing its business model, said it will shut down its portal of free Web-based personal information applications to focus on licensing its intelligent mobile transactions software to wireless carriers and mobile service providers. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. As part of the deal, Ants.com will have the potential to add 300,000 registered Zkey users to Scout, its automated tool that manages electronic address books on PCs. Ants.com, which began as a marketplace for freelance workers and employers, launched Scout, its address book management product, in February. A company spokesperson said that while Ants.com would continue to operate the freelance end of the business, its main focus is now the address book technology. Ants.com also said that Nick Desai, CEO of Zkey, will join the Ants.com board of advisers. Zkey said it would inform its users this month that it will no longer offer a contact management service and will recommend the transition to Scout. Ants.com's investors include Bertelsmann Ventures and Millennium Hanson. Zkey is backed by Bear Ventures, France Telecom, Omninet Capital, Oracle, and Zone Ventures.\nhttp://www.ants.com <http://venturewire.net/comp.asp?l=http://www.ants.com>\nhttp://www.zkey.com <http://venturewire.net/comp.asp?l=http://www.zkey.com>\nYour Business  Everywhere\n***********************************************\nRon Silverton\nDirector of Strategic Marketing\nAvocadoIT, Inc\n2211 N First Street, Suite 200\nSan Jose CA, 95131\nw 408.562-8039\nm 415.845-6789\nf 408.5622-8100\nwww.avocadoit.com\n*************************************************", "output": "MobileSys acquired Bitmo - - Organizations, Ants.com  - Organizations, Zkey - Organizations, Zkey - Organizations, MobileSys - Organizations, Bitmo - Organizations, Ron - Person Name, <http://venturewire.net/o_mailer.asp?sid=26816>  <http://venturewire.net/o_mailer.asp?sid=26816> SANTA BARBARA, Calif.  - URL, Nick Desai - Person Name, Ants.com's investors include Bertelsmann Ventures and Millennium Hanson.

That almost always makes\na task easier and at least more obviously possible.\nI think we all agree that nobody *really* wants to program in natural\nlanguage. Haven't you dealt with people enough to know that doing so\nwould be a Bad Idea? Anybody lived in the rural South lately?\nAs difficult as it is to get most people to speak English correctly, what\nmakes you think they would be able to program better using it?\n> In theory, spoken languages are precise in the sense that all the words have\n> (or should have) well defined meanings.  In practice, different people will\n> often interpret the same description in different ways.  Context plays an\n> important part in this, and what exactly 'context' consists of is very\n> difficult to determine (again, compared to 'context' in a programming\n> language).  These kinds of imprecision are much less of a problem with\n> programming languages, because programming languages are far simpler than\n> natural languages and are designed for a more specific purpose.\nTrue that.\nCheers,\ngh\nTo Post a message, send it to:   extremeprogramming@eGroups.com\nTo Unsubscribe, send a blank message to: extremeprogramming-unsubscribe@eGroups.com\nDon't miss XP UNIVERSE, the first US conference on XP and Agile Methods.  see www.xpuniverse.com for details and registration.\nYour use of Yahoo!

In these days of slimmed-down\ncapital IT expenditures, though, some companies will decide to take a pass\nat the latest and greatest wireless incarnations.\nPaytrust, an online bill management service, isn't one of them. While the\ncompany initially offered its customers wireless functionality in March 2000\nby partnering with AvocadoIT, a mobile application platform provider, that\napplication was built on HTML. Fast-forward nine months. After making the\ndecision to incorporate some upgrades and other changes to Paytrust's\nwireless bill delivery and payment applications, the powers that be at the\ncompany opted for a state-of-the-art approach by converting the entire\nservice to XML, which would allow the data to be viewed on any device.\n A good analogy to what Paytrust did is when a road needs to be widened from\ntwo lanes to three,  says Barry Phillips, director of customer marketing at\nAvocadoIT.  The company figured they might as well widen the road to four\nlanes and make the jump to XML so they could streamline operations by having\na single wireless infrastructure. They wanted to leverage what they had\nwithout having to start from scratch, and by converting to XML, the company\nalso became insulated from future changes on both the wireless and the data\nand application sides. \nIndeed, Paytrust's customers didn't witness any disruptions in service, and\nthey didn't have to learn how to use a new interface after the changeover.\nLike most online companies, Paytrust works with a wide variety of partners,\nincluding NetLedger and Yodlee. One important advantage to XML\nimplementation concerns relationships with these partners and the amount of\ntime it takes one partner to incorporate an updated application from\nanother. XML means that there is automatic wireless consistency across the\nboard. In introducing XML to its wireless applications, Paytrust didn't have\nto develop a different API for each of its 15 partners. Phillips estimates\nthat if they did, the job would have consumed 12 months for an in-house or\noutsourced developer.\nIn implementing XML, AvocadoIT also  future-proofed  Paytrust against a slew\nof handhelds, phones, and PDAs that have not yet seen the light of day.\n Today, some smart phones are using HDML and WML, and the new Ericsson\ncommunicator uses a landscape browser, which is a horizontal display,  says\nPhillips.  The only way to keep up with all of them is to add an XML adapter\nto a wireless application. \nDespite the benefits of a single XML wireless infrastructure, many\ncorporations will still resist the change, claiming shareholder concerns,\nthe shortage of labor, or the desire to wait for technology that is even\nmore whiz-bang.\nPhillips believes that this reluctance will start to be chipped away over\nthe next year.  As analysts talk more about the advantages of XML and\ncompanies have to make back-end changes anyway, more of them will look at\nXML,  he says.  It's just a matter of taking planned upgrades one step\nfurther. \n________________________\nRuben P.

According to analysts, this is a necessary step because\nthese companies' target is a workforce of consumers displaying diminishing\nbrand loyalty in order to access their business and personal data wherever\nthey are.\n These are the industries that are time-and location-sensitive,  said Kelly\nQuinn, senior analyst at Aberdeen Group, in Boston.\nFor traditional companies, maintaining existing customers rather than\nattracting new ones appears to be the greatest impetus for deploying a\nmobile solution. Mark Ebel, director of digital communication services at\nMinneapolis-based BestBuy, the No. 1 brick-and-mortar retailer in consumer\nelectronics in the United States with annual sales of $12.5 billion, noted\nthat an erosion of electronics purchases from brick-and-mortar stores is\nunder way.\n More than 500 consumer electronic stores closed in the past year alone, \nEbel said.\nIn response to this, BestBuy in the next 30 days will launch\nBestBuy.byair.com, a wireless shopping site. BestBuy's intention is to use\nits wireless site as another method to stay connected to its increasingly\nmobile customer base.\n In this age of geographic[ally] diverse individuals who travel and want to\nprovide gifts for family and friends, we believe Bestbuy.byair gives them a\nlocal feel,  Ebel said, adding that  The dot-com [component] is a wonderful\nmarketing tool. \nCurrently in development for BestBuy are personalized marketing initiatives\nto alert customers to products and services, and the company also is\ninvestigating location-based marketing via global positioning technology\nsoon to be in all cell phones.\nTechnology and marketing partners include Microsoft, which bought slightly\nless than 2 percent of BestBuy's equity for $200 million. ASP (application\nservice provider) GWCom will manage the wireless part of BestBuy's\ne-commerce activities, and AvocadoIT will supply the HTML to WML (Wireless\nMarkup Language) for WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) technology.\nAnd these companies are not the only ones looking to increase the face time\nwith their current customer base. GGP will launch its Mallibu.com site later\nthis month.\nChicago-based GGP has 136 properties in 36 states with 35 million visitors\nper year (almost 20 percent of the U.S. population), and a market cap of $8\nbillion. Nevertheless, company officials believe that m-commerce is\nessential to the company's long-term supremacy, according to Charlie Graves,\nsenior vice president for e-business at GGP.\nDuring the next year, GGP will roll out an increasingly robust site that\nwill include a Web site for every store in its malls. It will incorporate a\nlogistics component that includes an e-commerce drive-through for pickup of\nonline orders.\nThe wireless component is a key part of the initiative, Graves said.\n Because of the way malls are built with concrete and steel, you cannot get\na wireless signal in our properties. With microcells, I can program the\nmessaging in my world, specific to my mall. I can localize it tightly to\nflash an instant coupon, for example,  Graves said.\nGraves also sees the benefits of mobile commerce.\n We have shoppers coming to a mall 50 times a year, and I don't even know\ntheir names. Now we can market to them exactly what they want when they want\nit,  Graves said.\nBy 2004 there will be 1 billion cell phones worldwide, according to IDC, and\nhalf of them will be Internet-enabled.\nIn the travel world, Rosemont, Ill.-based Galileo, one of the four major\nreservation system companies, will be rolling out its mobile service to\ncorporate travel departments and travel agents later this year. Users will\nbe able to make and change flights reservation using their cell phones and\nbook rental cars and hotel rooms.\nOne industry analyst believes corporate agents will jump on the service as a\nway to keep track of changes made by its employees.\n Travelers tend to be cowboys who change their trips while they are\ntraveling. The Galileo system updates the corporate agency of any changes\nthe traveler makes and can be used to steer employees to preferred\ncarriers,  said Kate Rice, director of information services at Phocus\nWright, in Sherman, Conn.\nIn addition, tracking employee or department travel expenditures is helpful\nduring budget negotiations, Rice said.\nBut as these established brick-and-mortars stake their m-commerce claim,\nthey will face competition from pure-play Internet companies trying to\ndisplace them with their own mobile-commerce initiatives. One of those\ncompanies, VirtualBank, is expected to target high-tech companies that have\nprivate-label financial services with the first business-to-employee deals\nsigned with Compaq, storage giant EMC, and diversified company Textron.\nMeanwhile, some of the largest European banks are working with Compaq\nspin-off Tantau to deploy its mobile services platform in a partnership with\nHewlett-Packard. SE Banken of Sweden expects to have 5 million customers\nonline within three years, and Merita Bank, in Helsinki, Finland, is\nwrapping up a pilot with Tantau and expects 250,000 wireless banking\ncustomers by the end of the year.\n M-commerce will have a profound effect on the financial services industry, \nsaid Rory Brown, CEO of VirtualBank, a pure-play start-up with $40 million\nof backing from General Electric, Nokia, and DaimlerChrysler, plus a private\nplacement of funds from MCIWorldCom senior executives including CEO Bernie\nEbbers.\nBrown points out that Bank of America supports 10,000 physical locations and\nCharles Schwab, with an increasingly productive e-commerce site, has only\n400.\n If you look at the cost of a bank, a brick-and-mortar facility is holding\non to a commodity which they earn no money on. Half of it is handed out to\npeople, and the cash on hand is earning no money,  Brown said.\n____________________________\nGloria Chon\nAccount Coordinator\nCandelori Communications\n1270 Oakmead Parkway, Suite 314\nSunnyvale, CA  94086\nTel   408.774.3414 x227\nFax  408.774.3419\ngchon@candelori.com", "output": "Wed, 21 Jun 2000 - Date, Wed, 21 Jun 2000 - Date, <gchon@candelori.com> - Email, <mkadanoff@avocadoit.com> - Email, Ryan - Person Name, Gloria - Person Name, Ephraim Schwartz - Person Name, June 16,2000 - Date, http://www.idgnet.com/crd_idgsearch_0.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Einfoworld%\n2Ecom%2Farticles%2Fhn%2Fxml%2F00%2F06%2F19%2F000619hnmcommerce%2Exml&sc=4375\n5159_129872 - URL, BestBuy - Organizations, General Growth\nProperties (GGP) - Organizations, Galileo - Organizations, Kelly\nQuinn - Person Name, Aberdeen Group - Organizations, Boston. - Location, Mark Ebel - Person Name, Minneapolis - Location, United States - Location, Ebel - Person Name, BestBuy - Organizations, Microsoft - Organizations, AvocadoIT - Organizations, Chicago - Location, Charlie Graves - Person Name, Graves - Person Name, Graves - Person Name, Graves - Person Name, Rosemont, Ill - Location, Kate Rice - Person Name, Phocus\nWright - Organizations, Sherman, Conn. - Location, VirtualBank - Organizations, Compaq, storage giant EMC, and diversified company Textron. - Organizations, Hewlett-Packard.

In addition getting a NDA signed seems a bit extreme. If I was customer and I was qualified to sign an NDA before getting to understand the product I would think to myself,  Dude, these guys are paranoid.  Which in return will leave a bad first impression.\nAnother point to make is sometimes you never know who will show up for the dance. I've been in meeting were there is no technical guys that are scheduled, then all of a sudden they pour in during the meeting and I wind up doing a technical presentation. These have turned out to be the best situation because you get everyone there at once and when you see technical agreement after business talk, you are just about there to seal a scoping project.\nHere is my suggestions:\nI think they should have guidelines such as these, but I would leave it up to the Sales person to make a judgment call if they should or shouldn't bring a tech heavy in. Secondly I think they should be notified that sales engineers are to be used more thoughtfully then before. In addition, if the meeting is made within the vicinity of where the SE lives I don't see it as a bad thing to bring him in, unless they know for sure it is all business. Lastly the NDA seems a bit too much. I can't imagine breaking the flow of initial relationship with a NDA process thrown in.\nI still believe it is a great guideline for the sales person to use to determine if they need an SE. Also it may help them to get more details to qualify if the lead is real or not. Lastly it would be nice to know before I walk in what I'm dealing with, but it is not that big of a deal.\nJust some thoughts,", "output": "Dan - Person Name"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "id 3DX2LA10; Thu, 5 Jul 2001 20:22:11 -0700\nby mailer.avocadoit.com (8.11.3/8.11.3) with SMTP id f6634J825079\nfor <lisaq@AVOCADOIT.COM>; Thu, 5 Jul 2001 20:04:19 -0700\n(peer crosschecked as: chewbacca3.yesmail.net [64.37.207.78])\nid QQkwlh12095\nfor <lisaq@AVOCADOIT.COM>; Fri, 6 Jul 2001 03:20:54 GMT\nMessage-Id: <QQkwlh12095.200107060320@dfw7sosrv11.alter.net>\nErrors-To: bounce-shopper-12079305@zdemail.zdlists.com\nList-Subscribe: mailto:shopper@zdemail.zdlists.com?subject=subscribe\nList-Unsubscribe: mailto:shopper@zdemail.zdlists.com?subject=unsubscribe\nZDNet Buyers Alert Newsletter\t  Advertisement\nClick Here!\nRebates\nWhen ordering, make sure the reseller/manufacturer provides the rebate coupon you need.\nExpires July 14, 2001:\n$100 off Kodak DC4800 Camera\nExpires July 21, 2001:\n$70 off Kodak Personal Picture Maker 200\nExpires July 31, 2001:\n$50 off Epson Stylus Color 980\n$30 off Sony Spressa CRX140E/CH2 EIDE 8x4x32x\nExpires August 31, 2001:\n$30 off Epson Stylus Color 880\n$50 off HP 9900ci DVD/CD Writer Combo\nExpires September 29, 2001:\n$30 off Iomega External CD-RW 4x4x6x USB drive\nExpires September 30, 2001:\n$100 off Panasonic Palmcam PV-SD4090\n$100 off Panasonic Palmcam PV-SD5000\nExpires December 31, 2001:\n$100 off Palm VIIx with purchase of wireless service\n$50 off JamCam 3.0\n$30 off Polaroid PhotoMAX Fun Flash 640\n$20 off KB Gear Jam-It\n$50 off Yamaha LightSpeed CRW2100EZ\nExpires January 5, 2002:\n$30 off Iomega Internal CD-RW Drive 32x12x10x\nZDNet Top 5 Products\nBudget Scanners\n1.\t Canon CanoScan N650U\nPremier merchant:\nComark $98\n2.\t UMAX Astra 3400\nPremier merchant:\nComputers4Sure $63.99\n3.\t Visioneer OneTouch 5600 USB\n4.\t HP ScanJet 3400Cse\nPremier merchant:\nCDW $99\n5.\t HP ScanJet 2200C\nPremier merchant:\nComputers4sure $79\n--Janice Chen\nEditor-in-Chief\nComputer Shopper\nDEEP PRICE CUTS ON NAME-BRAND DESKTOPS\nDear Reader,\nGiven the nose-dive that PC prices have been taking, I have been keeping an eye on this category for you and found some great deals recently.

We're very excited by the prospect of welcoming WeSync to the Palm family -- for more information on the acquisition, please see the official press release.\nPuppy Love\nTop\nCarole K. of California uses MyPalm for a very special cause. As the coordinator for  Pet Pals,  a pet-assisted therapy group, she keeps the schedule of 28 volunteers and 30 dogs. In teams, the volunteers and their dogs visit local hospitals, nursing homes, elementary schools and a number of other places where people may need a dose of puppy love. Carole has set up a Group in MyPalm so that the volunteers can keep on top of their hairy schedules. Now that Carole no longer needs to call numerous volunteers and organizations for minor scheduling updates, she attests,  MyPalm has allowed me peace of mind. \nTell us how you are using MyPalm.

They labeled them company A-F.  I wouldn't waste much time trying to match companies to the questions.  Sun and Gartner made the project requirements very clear and we know that we are once again up against Aether and Brience.\nWe will probably need to manage the EMAS similar to the way do for UUNET/Exodus.  They said that they expect for the development to be done offsite.\nOf course we will have the issue of EMDS not being on Solaris.  If anything is going to disqualify us from this project, this could be it.  However, the RFP is set up to be scored by the different requirements with different weights and it does not call out the development tools needing to be on Solaris.  We can hope that this would not affect the overall score too much.\nIn terms of how to handle a CGE&Y invitation, I think that will depend on who CGE&Y has already thought about partnering with.  Accenture appears strong in the account.  Accenture has  knowledge/access to MySales and CGE&Y asked a question during the meeting that indicated they don't have that knowledge.  I wouldn't spend resources with CGE&Y on this one.   It would be a no win situation.  If CGE&Y won with us, it would piss off Accenture.\nI can't see how CGE&Y could win with Brience given that KPMG will be working with Brience.  I saw Brience exchanging cards with Bill Fournell (CGE&Y) near the coffee machine during a break.  I don't think that Bill knew the people from Brience who attended (this could have been a show).  This doesn't mean that they are not going to try.  It's funny, but the guy from Aether also exchanged cards with Bill during the break.    The Aether buy left my card and Bill's card in front of him on the table the second part of the meeting.   In a way, it was like playing poker - lot's of straight faces.\nRobert", "output": "Dan - Person Name, Sun - Organizations, Gartner  - Organizations, Aether and Brience - Organizations, CGE&Y - Organizations, Accenture - Organizations, Accenture  - Organizations, Accenture - Organizations, Accenture - Organizations, CGE&Y - Organizations, CGE&Y - Organizations, Accenture - Organizations, CGE&Y - Organizations, Brience - Organizations, KPMG - Organizations, Brience - Organizations, Brience - Organizations, Bill Fournell  - Person Name, CGE&Y - Organizations, Bill - Person Name, Brience - Organizations, Aether - Organizations, Bill - Person Name, Aether - Organizations, Bill - Person Name, Robert - Person Name"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "id GKWN5MT2; Mon, 6 Mar 2000 23:11:37 -0800\nid 38B4783600093878; Mon, 6 Mar 2000 23:14:06 -0800\nPlease mark your calenders for this Wednesday - March 8- at 6 pm  to review advertising concepts.

Two items are of particular interest:  their head of Software Strategy will be speaking aobut a  tech recession  and the guy who covers some of their mobile software infrastructure will be speaking about companies new focus on ROI, highlighting Openwave/Phone.com\nRon\nWhat to Expect from the CSFB Software CC Today\nSoftware Strategy - Preview of the Software Strategy Conf Call\nGeorge Gilbert - Where to Look For if We Are in a 'Tech Recession ?\nWe believe the dot.com bubble appears likely to expand somewhat into a wider\ncapital spending slowdown.  Many co's are already reporting less linearity\nin their quarters.  1st tier vendors are expanding share as customers invite\nfewer vendors to each evaluation.  Although public IT Services co's have\nseen a severe slowdown, software co's see them as separate channel from core\nBig 5 Systems Integrators. What became most clear last week was that\nself-service Enterprise Information Portals (EIP) are the next step in Web\napplications beyond personalization.  The biggest beneficiaries will\nprobably be the Web application server vendors. We believe vendors facing\nstrongest demand: SEBL (Siebel Systems, $73.4, Strong Buy) , EPNY\n(e.Piphany, $37.8, Strong Buy), VRTS (Veritas, $13.5, Restricted) , BEAS\n(BEA Systems, $58.8, Strong Buy).  Facing weakest demand: MSFT (Microsoft,\n$56.4,Not Rated), as the PC upgrade cycle gets pushed out\nEBusiness Applications - Preview of the Software Strategy Conf Call\nBrent Thill - Where to Look if We are in a 'Tech Recession'?\nCorporate spending on software apps remains robust. However, we are seeing a\nsector rotation towards apps that deliver  an immediate and measurable ROI.\nWe believe a shift in spending patterns will favor supply chain/marketplace\ninfrastructure vendors such as ITWO (i2 Tech, $88, Strong Buy), and AGIL\n(Agile Software, $50, Buy). But who could possibly hurt would be: BVSN\n(Broadvision, $19.1, Buy) and KANA (KANA, $12, Buy).\nInternet Infrastructure Software - Preview of Software Conference Call\nTodd Raker - Where to Look if We are in a 'Tech Recession'?\nFocus from the co's in our group appears to be on proving immediate ROI in\nterms of the end capabilities to their customers. We believe that network\nsecurities stocks will remain very strong going into next 12 months. We\nbelieve that incremental demand is weakening on the margin (dot.com exposure\nappears to be an issues for most co's in our space).  Our thesis is not\nconcerned so much with who whether numbers will be missed are not but more\nwith which co's and by how much will outperform. We would highlight OPWV\n(Openwave, $52.2, Strong Buy) which has an interesting ROI story and VRSN\n(VeriSign, $87, Strong Buy).\nEnabling Infrastructure for Post-PC Era\n************************************\nRon D Silverton\nDirector of Strategic Marketing\nAvocadoIT, Inc.\n2211 North First Street\nSuite 200\nSan Jose, CA 95131\nTel: 408.562.8039\nMobile: 415.845.6789\nFax:  408.562.8100\nrsilverton@avocadoit.com\n************************************", "output": "Ron - Person Name, George Gilbert - Person Name, SEBL (Siebel Systems, $73.4, Strong Buy) , EPNY\n(e.Piphany, $37.8, Strong Buy), VRTS (Veritas, $13.5, Restricted) , BEAS\n(BEA Systems, $58.8, Strong Buy). - Organizations, MSFT (Microsoft, - Organizations, ITWO (i2 Tech, $88, Strong Buy), and AGIL\n(Agile Software, $50, Buy).  - Organizations, BVSN\n(Broadvision, $19.1, Buy) and KANA (KANA, $12, Buy). - Organizations, Todd Raker  - Person Name, (Openwave, $52.2, Strong Buy) which has an interesting ROI story and VRSN\n(VeriSign, $87, Strong Buy). - Organizations, Ron D Silverton - Person Name, AvocadoIT, Inc.\n2211 North First Street\nSuite 200\nSan Jose, CA 95131 - Address, Tel: 408.562.8039\nMobile: 415.845.6789\nFax:  408.562.8100 - Phone Number, rsilverton@avocadoit.com - Email"}, {"instruction": "Identify Personal Identifiable Information from text and label entities as ('Person Name', 'Organizations', 'Brand Name', 'Location', 'Date', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Address', 'URL', 'Internal Reference ID')", "input": "Matt,\nI just got off the phone with Peter Lowber.
